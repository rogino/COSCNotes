# 09. Location

Location sources:

- GPS
  - ~5-10 m accuracy
  - Timing precision in the order of 20 ns
    - Requires special/general theories of relativity to be taken into effect
- Cell-ID (cell tower triangulation)
- Wi-Fi network

Android has three methods to obtain location:

- GPS
  - Most accurate and most energy intensive
  - Only works outdoors
- Network Location Provider: combines Cell-ID and Wi-Fi data
- Passive: piggybacks off other applications

Permissions:

```xml
<manifest>
  // Foreground: one-off access to location
  <uses-permission
    android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"
  />
  // If you want fine access, you must also request coarse
  // Gives you accses to GPS location
  <uses-permission
    android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"
  />
  // Background: requires permission on API level 29 and higher
  <uses-permission
    android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION"
  />
</manifest>
```

Older approach was easy to get wrong: forgetting to disable it and leading to large battery drain:

- Use `LocationManager` to get access to system location services
  - `getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE)`
- Implement `LocationListener` subclass: override `onLocationChanged`, `onStatusChanged`, `onProviderEnabled`, `onProviderDisabled` methods

Newer approach uses Google Play Services and provides a higher-level API:

- Provides Fused Location Provider: combines multiple location sources in a unified interface
- ```kotlin
  fusedLocationClient = LocationServices.getFusedLocationProviderClient(this)
  fusedLocationClient.lastLocation.addOnSuccessListener {location: Location? -> 
    // Check to ensure accuracy hasn't dropped significantly (e.g. if phone switched from GPS to network)
  }
  ```
- Can also request location requests using `LocationCallback:onLocationResult`
- Geofencing
  - Set entrance and exit events
  - Max. 100 geofences per app
  - Requires fine location, background location permissions
