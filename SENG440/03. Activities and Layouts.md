# 03. Activities and Layout

## App Manifest

Declares several app components:

Activities:

- The most fundamental component of the Android application model
- Roughly corresponds to a screen-ful of user interaction.
- An entry point for user interaction into the app
  - Instead of a `main` method, there is a main activity declared in the manifest
- Subclasses of the `Activity` class
  - Or a specialized type like `AppCompatActivity` or `ComponentActivity`
- Registration in app manifest:

    ```xml
    <manifest ...>
      <application ...>
      ...
        <activity
          android:name=".NameOfActivityClass"
          android:exported="true">
          <intent-filter>
            <!-- Register the activity as the one that executes on app launch -->
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>

            <!-- Make the activity show up as an entry in the app launcher -->
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>`
          </intent-filter>
        </activity>
      </application>
    </manifest>
    ```



Fragments:

- Re-usable pieces of UI that are owned by an activity.

Services:

- Application component that performs long-running operations in the background

Content providers:

- Bridge between applications to share data
- Mostly built into the system; you do not usually create new ones yourself

Broadcast receivers:

- Components that responds to system-wide announcement
- e.g. battery low, screen off
- It is also possible to initiate broadcasts from within an application

## Activity

Activity stack:

- Navigation represented as a stack of activities, with the current activity on top
- When going back, the top activity is popped off the stack and destroyed
- Beware of creating and pushed multiple instances of the same activity to the stack rather than popping to the existing instance

### Lifecycle

                 Finished/destroyed

                         ▼
                      onDestroy
```

- `onCreate`:
  - Occurs on app launch, or if Android kills the process to free memory and the user returns to the app
- `onStart`
  - An activity is stopped (`onStopped`) if the activity is no longer visible.
   - If the user navigates back to the activity, it may be restarted (`onRestart`)
- `onResume`
  - A activity is paused (`onPaused`) if another activity comes into the foreground
  - The activity may be partially obscured by another activity and interactions may be disabled
  - When the user returns to the activity


Primary states:

- Active:
  - Activity is in the foreground, and user can interact with it
- Paused:
  - Activity is partially obscured, user cannot interact with it (e.g. when menu/dialog open)
- Stopped:
  - Completely hidden and not visible to the user
  - Instance and variables retained, but no code is executed
  - Examples of scenarios when an activity is stopped:
    - User receives a phone call
    - User performs an action that starts another activity in the application
    - Phone rotation: activity (and the whole UI) is stopped and re-created

Lifetimes:

- Entire lifetime (`onCreate`/`onDestroy`):
  - Load the UI
  - Start and stop threads that should always be running
- Visible lifetime (`onStart`/`onStop`)
  - Access or release resources that influence the UI
  - Write to files if necessary
  - Write information to files if necessary
- Foreground lifetime (`onResume`/`onPause`)
  - Restore state and save state
  - Access/release
    - Broadcast receivers
    - Sensors (e.g. GPS, camera)
  - Start/stop video playback
  - Start/stop animations

Programmatically stopping an activity:

- Generally shouldn't be done: let Android manage it for you
- Call when you absolutely do not want the user to return to the instance of the activity
- Call the `finish` or `finishActivity` methods

## Architecture

Previously, the recommended architecture was a **multiple activity** architecture.

However, after the `Navigation` component Jetpack library was introduced in 2018, Google started to recommend a **single activity-multiple fragment** architecture.

This:

- Simplifies data sharing between different screens in an application using a `SharedViewModel`
- Simplifies the manifest file

Architectural principles:

- Separation of concerns: modularity, encapsulation
- Model-view design:
  - Persistent model independent of views
  - Allows multiple views of the same model (e.g. for different screen sizes)
- Each component has its own lifecycle


### Views, View Groups and Layouts

- View: visible, interactive UI element
- ViewGroup: invisible container used to hierarchically and spatially organize views and view groups
  - Usually called **Layouts** and implement defined layout structures (e.g. `LinearLayout`, `ConstraintLayout`)
- Layouts can be declared as XML resources:
  - Enables separation of presentation from behaviour
  - Allows different layouts to be created for different device sizes
