# 08. Monitoring and Detecting Intrusions

> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

Intrusion detection systems: IDS

## In recent news: [Microsoft Teams GIFShell Attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gifshell-attack-creates-reverse-shell-using-microsoft-teams-gifs/)

Convince user to install a stager. Once done:

- Command execution:
  - Attacker sends GIF with embedded commands
  - Teams logs the message in publicly accessible logs
  - Stager can then extract commands from GIF and execute them
- Exfiltration:
  - Teams survey card filename has no length limit
  - Stager submits card to the attacker's public webhook
- Initial infection:
  - Sharepoint link generated for any files that are uploaded
  - When message sent, contains a POST request with SharePoint link to that file (e.g. image)
  - Attacker can replace that URL and Teams will display it as the original file type
    - e.g. send execute as an image: when user clicks it, it will download it
    - Can also use deep links to Excel etc., which may have vulnerabilities that allow RCE
  - By default, Teams messages can be received from people outside the organization

## Hardware

### Hardware-level Protection Mechanisms

Intel requires that privilege level can only be changed by kernel processes:

- However, the instruction set is not designed for virtualization; workarounds
- Software Guard eXtension (SGX) creates *enclave* - encrypted, trusted zone

ARM uses TrustZone to:

- Support hardware-level cryptographic functions
- Lock phones to networks
- Run licensed/critical code (e.g. fingerprint, SIM operations)

Hardware sandboxing with CHERI (ARM):

- Allows fine-grained support to isolate processes at the CPU level
- Enables sandboxed memory allocations
- e.g. each browser tab runs in a separate process

Issues with enclaves:

- Puts a very high level of trust on the manufacturer
- DRM
- TODO:
  - IN THE EXAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  - In relation to protection rings:
    - Protecting access to hardware via software access control (e.g. kernel/userspace barrier)
    - Or running completely separate (specialized?) hardware
    - e.g. bank apps on Android can use Secure Environment
- Downsides: any vulnerabilities in the apps/endpoints using them can allow very low-level access to the hardware (e.g. cryptographic keys used for device boot)
- [Intel SGX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mNoLrKYQFo):
  - Untrusted section can create one or more enclaves in encrypted memory
    - Enclaves cannot be modified after they are built
  - Untrusted sections can later call functions in the enclave
  - SGX depreciated in 11/12th gen core processors
    - 4K Blu-rays require it; users won't be able to view content they bought at the highest quality in the future
  - [Intel SGX Explained](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/086.pdf)
    - Runs at ring 3 only (-1/hypervisor, 0/kernel, 1-2/drivers (not really used), 3/application)
- [AMD TrustZone](https://sefcom.asu.edu/publications/trustzone-explained-cic2016.pdf)
    - ARM: has multiple processor modes (e.g. user, supervisor, system, ..., hypervisor)
    - TrustZone: secure and non-secure states (i.e. orthogonal to rings)
    - Can partition SoC peripherals (e.g. areas of RAM only used by secure mode)

### Mobile Platforms

OS:

- iOS: simplified BSD with separate secure enclave
- Android: simplified Linux with SELinux features

App management:

- iOS: walled garden, with all apps being reviewed Apple
- Android: signed by developers, with some being 'Play Protect Verified'

Permissions:

- Android:
  - 'Dangerous' permissions must be accepted by users at run-time (post-Android 8)
    - Previously, would be shown during install and people would just click yes
    - Now users allow/deny one by one: allows them to make more informed decisions
  - Vendors can define their own permissions: can lead to fragmentation
  - [SoK: Lessons Learned from Android Security Research for Appified Software Platforms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7546516):
    - Users cannot associate privacy risks with permissions; may underestimate or overestimate risks
    - Insecure IPC (exposed activities?): other apps can use this for privilege escalation
    - Web views: web to app/app to web for privilege escalation and data leakage
    - Permissions:
      - Over-privileged applications
      - Ad and other libraries running in same process and inheriting same privileges
      - Only shown on install/first use, not whenever the permissions are actually used
      - No mandatory access control (until SELinux)
    - APIs
      - Lack of good secure remote code loading API lead to unsigned implementations
      - MITM attacks in 95% of cases where developers customised TLS certificate validation

## Monitoring and Response

### MAPE-K control loop

(Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute), Knowledge.

Circa 2003, need for *autonomic managers* overlooking the functioning of running systems:

- Self-configuring: system can deploy nodes on-demand
- Self-healing: the system can handle failing components
- Self-optimizing: able to manager the workload dynamically
  - Important for cloud workloads where you pay by CPU hours etc.

Using a knowledge source (log files, system events):

- Monitor a collecting of 'interesting' events; pass problematic ones onto the next step
- Analyze the collected data (and predictions) and evaluate the issue
- Plan a change in accordance with policies
- Execute the plan (multiple actions/steps)

#### Exercise: MAKE-K on Assignment 2 Codebase

- What aspects of the system should be logged?
  - System load (e.g. requests/minute, CPU usage)
  - Actions taken to the system (to allow rollbacks)
- What data do you need to be captured? Why?
  - For each request, IP addresses, user agents etc.
  - POST requests, uploads etc.: non-sensitive data
    - Usernames probably not sensitive, although users may accidentally type their passwords into their username fields
  - Access to admin panels
  - Request response times
  - CPU, RAM, disk usage
  - Database queries, number of rows returned, processing time
  - Non-standard requests (e.g. unused ports, unsupported protocols)
- What safety measures can you apply automatically?
  - Append-only logs or cloned logs
  - Notify admin (e.g. through email) when anomalous events occur
  - IP throttling/bans (e.g. `fail2ban`)
  - Recaptcha
  - Disabling pings, unused protocols etc. (or isolating it onto a different machine)
    (e.g. admin panel login/password change, low disk, high CPU, long response times)

Quality attributes:

- How can you achieve self-configuration
- What part of the system should self-heal?
- Is managing the workload simply a matter of increasing resources?
  - Or is this a symptom of an issue?

### Base Rate Fallacy

Assuming that 'interesting' events are uncommon:

- The base rate is the ratio of 'interesting' events to total events
- A small **false positive** rate is large given a large population
- This may lead to a **vast majority** of identified events being false positives

People cannot go through a thousand events to find the one true positive:

### Intrusion Detection Systems

These can be categorized into three main techniques:

- Signature-based:
  - Identify specific **patterns** that match known-bad patterns
  - Fast and low false-positive rate
  - Can only detect known attacks
  - Need examples of malicious traffic
  - Rules defined at the low-level
  - The more rules you define, the more resources are required to monitor the traffic occurring in real-time
- Specification-based:
  - Events deviate from per-application specifications of legitimate actions
    - Model the normal trends; anything outside that raises an alarm
  - Uses manually-developed, system- or protocol-specific specifications
  - Deep understanding of the system required
  - Behavioral model of the system required
    - Needs a working implementation, possibly in active use, or a similar application to model this
  - Can detect new attacks
  - Not flexible to changes to the system - requires security-oriented testing during development
- Anomaly-based:
  - Machine learning used to record the steady state: requires recording of current system behavior
  - Cannot detect anomalies that were present during the training stage
  - Can detect new attacks
  - May have a higher false-positive rate compared to other techniques
    - If expected behavior wasn't captured during training
    - Changes to the system will require re-training
      - Difficult to model what is normal behavior - what if it is currently being attacked?

Factors to consider:

- Initial setup and deployment
- Types of detected events
- Flexibility to new events
- Extensibility by practitioners

[Snort](https://youtu.be/W1pb9DFCXLw?t=126):

- Low-level IDS
- Packet sent to decoder:
  - Determines packet protocol (e.g. IP, TCP)
  - Checks for malformed packets, anomalies in the header
- Preprocessors:
  - Checks for IPs that are banned etc.
  - Deals with IP refragmentation etc.
  - Processes and normalizes the data into a standardized format
- Detection:
  - Snort rules, custom detectors applied
- Log and verdict:
  - Discard and log the packet, or send it to the downstream machine

All IDSes have a pipe-and-filter architecture, with the fastest, most basic rules being applied first to remove the most obvious bad packets.

## Networking

LANs:

- Hubs: broadcasts packets to all connected devices
  - An infected device can monitor all traffic
- Switches: sends packets to only the receiver
  - Isolates traffic and may allow firewall rules to be applied

Ethernet:

- Packet sniffing
- Hardware-supported sniffing
  - Port mirror: switch duplicates traffic to another device
  - Test access port (TAP): port which reads the traffic going through the device

TCP:

- Three-way handshake
- SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK
- SYN: send initial sequence number
- ACK: acknowledge receipt of the sequence number
- Each packet increments the sequence number

DDoS:

- TCP doesn't validate the sender's IP address: can use this to make servers flood
  the victim with packets

IDSs contain rules to detect suspicious activities:

- Ingress: filter packets entering the network/machine
- Egress: filter packets leaving the machine/network

DNS poisoning:

- Inject fake DNS entry to DNS server
- DNS servers synchronize with each other, so the poisoned entry spreads
