Encryption works. The problem is everything else.

## OWASP Top 10

Open Web Application SEcurity Project


A07:2021 â€“ Identification and Authentication Failures


- Automated attacks: credential stuffing, brute force
- Weak/default passwords
- Insecure password storage
- No/ineffective MFA
- Session identifier exposed in URL
- Reuse of session identifier
- Session IDs not validated

## Insecure Design

Security flaws caused by:

- Inappropriate or reckless **design decisions** that lead to potential risk
  - Lack of knowledge, time pressure, wrong definition of deployment constraints
- Careless exposition or transfer of sensitive data
  - e.g. passwords, phone numbers being sent in logs

Secure design lifecycle as a drier:

- Careful and continuous threat modelling
- Active monitoring of vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies
- Apply least-privilege principles TODO TODO
