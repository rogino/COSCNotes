# 05. Secure Coding Principles

## OWASP Top 10 (Class)

01. Broken Access Control:

- Users can act outside their intended permissions
- Causes:
  - Not following principle of last privilege
  - Lack of access control on some endpoints
  - Account manipulation: manipulating URLs, cookies, unique IDs
  - CORS misconfiguration
- Countermeasures:
  - Deny by default
  - Only allow resource owners, not all users, to CRUD
  - Re-use authentication systems (e.g. middleware)
  - Follow standards (e.g. JWT)
- Example:
  - MV720 GPS tracker: unsecured HTTP endpoint

02. Cryptographic failure:

- Sensitive data exposed due to weak or non-existent cryptographic algorithms
- Causes
  - Plain-text communication
  - Old/insecure algorithms
  - Hardcoded passwords
  - Insufficient randomness
- Countermeasures
  - Store only required data
  - Don't cache sensitive data
  - Key rotation, proper IV generation etc.
- Example:
  - Solana Slope wallet: seed phrases sent in plaintext to central server

03. Injection attack:

- Executing user-provided code through an app to another system
- Most frequent: SQL Injection
- Causes:
  - Unsanitized user input
  - Dynamic queries with no content escaping
- Countermeasures:
  - Prepared statements, parameterized queries
  - Escape user input
- Example:
  - SonicWall (~500K customers): SQL injection issue

04. Insecure Design

- Some service with insecurities caused by its design and architecture, not the implementation

05. Security Misconfiguration:

- Very broad: security not set up, set up poorly, or misconfigured
- Causes:
  - Unnecessary features enabled:
    - Ports, services accounts
    - Default/unused applications may have vulnerabilities, be outdated
    - Revealing to much information through logs/error messages
  - Poor coding practices, default passwords, forgetting to re-enable firewall after testing
- Countermeasures:
  - Update configuration policies regularly
  - Minimize attack surface
  - Automatic configuration deployment (e.g. containers): make redeployment easy
- Example:
  - Jira: visibility of new projects was set to public by default? Adversary that link had access to all data in the project?

06. Vulnerable Components

- Part of system/application which extends the functionality
- Causes:
  - The component may be unsupported, out-of-date, or otherwise vulnerable
  - An attacker may be able to exploit that vulnerability to attack other systems
- Countermeasures:
  - Remove unused dependencies
  - Check they are being maintained
  - Keep a centralized list of dependencies and have a process in place to maintain it
  - Obtain dependencies from trusted sources
  - Don't broadcast your dependencies

07. Authentication Failure

- Bad handling of user identity, authentication, session management
- Causes:
  - Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing
  - Default/well-known passwords
  - No/bad 2FA
  - Mishandling session identifiers (e.g. session ID in URL, re-use of identifiers after login)
  - 'Forgot password' flaws
  - Weak password storage
- Countermeasures:
  - Good 2FA
  - Secure admin credentials, not default
  - Check password against requirements, bad password lists
- Example:
  - CVE-2022-26138: Atlassian Confluence contains account with hard-coded user (`disabledsystemuser`) and password defined in plaintext config file
  - UC library room booking: HTTP

08. Security Logging/Monitoring Failures

- Insufficient logging
- Exposure of sensitive information in log files
- Causes:
  - Relevant information not logged
  - Logs not examined
  - Logs not backed up in case of server failure or breach
  - Logging systems not tested
  - Logging levels not used appropriately, exposing sensitive data
- Countermeasures:
  - Ensure logs include sufficient context (and are encoded correctly to prevent injection)
  - Ensure logs are in more than on place
  - Regular system monitoring
- Examples
  - CodeFusion 8: failed authentication attempts not logged; brute force attacks possible
  - NetProxy 4.03: did not log requests that did not have 'http://' in the URL

09. Server-side request forgery

- Application reads data from a URL; attacker can supply their own credential to their own URL or an internal path (e.g. to file containing credentials)
- Causes:
  - Trusting user credentials
  - Not following principle of least privilege
- Countermeasures:
  - Use allowlists for IP addresses, hosts that the application should be able to access
  - Block requests to private IPs
  - Verify response bodies
  - Block non-HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- Example:
  - UC Scrumboard: can specify GitLab URL. Server checks if they get a response, and if they get a valid Git response
    - If you pass in `localhost:$port`, attacker can iterate through ports to determine what ports are in use

## Unsafe Constructs

### TOCTOU Race

When there is a time lapse between **time-of-check** to *time-of-use*:

- Two elements (e.g. processes, threads) concurrently making use of the same shared resource
- System interruptions can allow an adversary to substitute files
  - May often be exploited with temporary files, especially those with a known/predictable path
  - Example:
    - Process checks if user can access the file
    - Attacker replaces file with a symlink/hardlink (e.g. to `/etc/passwd`)
    - Process allows user to read restricted file
  - Countermeasures:
    - Use **file descriptors** instead (i.e. open once)
    - Span child processes with restricted permissions
    - Disallow creation of files by root (e.g. C compilation)
      - Lots of temporary files with well-known file paths?
      - If process reuses existing files instead of re-creating, attacker could inject malicious code?

### Overflow Issues (Mostly C/C++)

This may cause the system may crash or read garbage data. However, an attacker may be able to exploit this.

Weak type safety: C will silently convert integers by keeping the least significant bits. After overflow of a signed integer, the value will be the maximum negative number.

Pointer arithmetic:

- C uses pointer + offset
- Array element size defines the step in bytes, with index for the offset
- No bounds-checks on array accesses by default
- If index is user-controlled and not sanitized, it may allow an attacker to read/write to arbitrary memory

Buffer overflow and NOP slide:

- For each function call, the stack contains function arguments, local variables, return address
- Buffer overflow of local variables may allow attacker to overwrite the return address, allowing them to jump to any address
- No-operation (NOP) slide:
  - Hard to predict where exactly the attacker-controlled payload is
  - Fill memory before the payload with NOPs: processor will simply go through the NOP instructions until it gets to the payload
  - The NOP sled means that the attacker does not need to know the exact memory address of the payload

Coding practices:

- Type-safety, static code analysis:
  - Uses languages with type-safe construct/libraries where possible
  - Bounds-checking e.g. overflow flags, unchecked memory overwrites
  - Non-executable stacks or heaps (although it prevents just-in-time interpretation/execution)
  - OS-level protection: address space layout randomization (ASLR)
- Least privilege, zero-trust knowledge:
  - Authorized access by default: public access should be the exception
  - Use securely-generated tokens, HTTP-only flags in cookies (to prevent client-side JS (e.g. malicious extensions) from reading it)
  - Treat other components with care, **segment internal networks**
