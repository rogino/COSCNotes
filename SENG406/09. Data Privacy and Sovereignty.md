# 09. Data Privacy and Sovereignty

## Current Events: GitLab RCE

Any user with a login could remotely execute code through the GitHub import feature.

Patched in 15.3.1/15.2.3/15.1.5

Communication:

- None until patch was released
- Workarounds released in case organizations do not/cannot upgrade
- No individual communication with organizations
- UC did not know about the issue

## Current Events: Optus Hack

2nd largest telecommunications company in Australia. 5 million driver's license/passports stolen.

Broken access control: faulty API which allowed the attacker to dump a large amount of data.

Initially released 10K entries as proof and requested million dollar ransom; apparently changed their mind and deleted the data.

## TODO

Open source vs in-house development:

- Often have contribution guidelines
- Use issue trackers to present to the community work to be done
- Code of conduct: how people within the community should behave

[NZ Google Street View Wi-Fi collection](https://privacy.org.nz/publications/commissioner-inquiries/google-s-collection-of-wifi-information-during-street-view-filming/) (2010):

[digital.govt.nz on GDPR](https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/privacy-security-and-risk/privacy/public-sector-responsibility/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/):

> While the GDPR imposes additional obligations on agencies, and provides additional privacy rights to EU residents, an agency is likely to comply with most of its obligations under the GDPR if it complies with the Privacy Act.

No...

  - Cryptography requirements
- Uses multi-level security (top-secret -> unclassified)

Secure coder review:

- IN THE EXAM
- https://owasp.org/www-project-go-secure-coding-practices-guide/
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9230284/
- EXAM
  - Four questions
  - 30 marks
  - Open book
  - First two: essay-type
  - Third: related to first assignment (some drawing)
  - Forth: a few easy questions

Penetration testing on live systems:

- May cause crashes or heavy load, impacting legitimate users
- Bug bounties: running on sandboxed systems and has a legal framework
- Disclosure: what happens if the company does not fix it?

Māori Data Sovereignty:

- [Te Mana Raraunga](https://www.temanararaunga.maori.nz) network:
  - Founded in 2016
  - Individuality vs collective ownership
  - All data collected from Māori should belong to Māori
  - Data should be analyzed in context with help from Māori
  - Six principles:
    - Rangatiratanga: authority and self-determination
    - Whakapapa: data in their relationships
    - Whanaungatanga: obligations and accountability
    - Kotahitanga: collective benefit and capacity
      - Not just for a private benefit
    - Manaakitanga: reciprocity, respect and consent
      - Ask for consent
    - Kaitiakitanga: guardianship and ownership
      - Build knowledge within the Māori community

Patriot Act (9/11), CLOUD Act (2018):

- Government can request access to any and all data held in US servers or US-led companies
- Lots of companies based in Ireland (for tax purposes): government wanted access and was not allowed by the courts
  - The fix? Write a new law to allow it

China National Intelligence Law:

- Applies to all Chinese-led companies or those registered in China
- Allows all means necessary to carry out intelligence work

Local legal agreements can prevent data transfer:

- Auditing of data sometimes requires formal approval (e.g. unions in France)
- GDPR picky on data storage location (mutual exchange agreement)
- GDPR and CLOUD can conflict
  - US requests must comply with GDPR

VPNs vs Tor:

- Tor:
  - Access to Tor via rendezvous points
  - Data goes through intermediaries: proxies
  - Data encrypted multiple times (3 should be enough)
  - Only the entry node knows your IP address
  - Tor exit nodes may be known
  - Tor provides anonymity
- VPNs:
  - VPNs provide privacy
  - Data sent to server to mask your IP
  - Server must be trusted: it knows your identity and the sites being visited
  - VPN servers may be known
