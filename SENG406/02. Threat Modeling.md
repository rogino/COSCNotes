# 02. Threat Modeling

'Classic' plan-based process:

- Sequential process:
  - Requirements
  - Design
  - Test plans
  - Coding
  - Testing
  - Deployment/maintenance
- 90s: the internet becomes a thing. Hacking also became a thing.
- Security-related activities jammed into the process
  - User risk analysis
  - Design risk analysis
  - Static code analysis
  - Developer training
  - Coding standards development
  - Security metrics development
  - Penetration tests
    - Breaking into real systems

Secure development lifecycle (SDLC):

- Requirement: security and privacy assessment, project plan
- Architecture: poly assessment, architecture choices
- Design: security test plan, threat modeling
- Development: code quality assurance (e.g. static analysis, fuzzing)
- Release: policy-compliance analysis, vulnerability scan, penetration testing

e.g. how well-trained are users in detecting phishing attempts? Even if you can't measure it, you can still implement training.

Security assessment:

- Early-stage planning
- Discover and document relevant security aspects and turn them into functional requirements:
  - Identify key persons, laws, standards, infrastructure, third-parties
  - Plan security-related processes (e.g. coding, testing, review, certificating)
  - Define reporting and monitoring objectives
    - React in real-time to anomalous conditions (e.g. system overload, DDOS attacks)
- Privacy impact assessment
  - Exhaustive list of collected data
  - Understanding of legislating
  - Education on data retention, manipulation
  - Least-privilege as a core driver

Architecture:

- Policy assessment and scoping:
  - Define security objectives (e.g. expected level of security, accepted risk)
  - Refine definitions of assets (e.g. new entry point, dependencies)
  - Decompose software in subsystems: for all subsystems, identify threats
  - Threat space:
    - STRIDE
      - Spoofing
        - Accessing/using another user's credentials
      - Tampering
        - Maliciously changing or modifying persistent data or data in-transit
      - Repudiation
      - Information disclosure
        - Accessing data that they should not have access to
      - Denial of service
        - Denying access to valid users
      - Elevation of privilege
        - Gaining access to previleged resources to access information or compromise a system

Modelling data flows:

```
                                       Trusted Space
                                     |
                         _____       
---------    data      /       \     | sanitized     ----------
| Actor |  ------->   | Process | ----------------->  Database
---------              \       /     |   data        ----------
                         -----  
                                     |
```

|  Element  | Spoof. | Tamper. | Repudiat. | Info. Discl. | DoS | Priv. Elev. |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | --------- | ------------ | --- | ----------- |
| Data flow |        |    x    |           |      x       |  x  |             |
|   Store   |        |    x    |           |      x       |  x  |             |
|  Process  |   x    |    x    |     x     |      x       |  x  |      x      |
|   Actor   |   x    |         |     x     |              |     |             |

- Need to specify the semantics of the data flow: is it payment data? the weather?
- The diagram should model process and data flow, not sub-systems

Software detailed design:

- Security testing plan:
  - Dedicated test scripts for security aspects (i.e. test STRIDE threats)
  - Identify key stakeholders and resources (including knowledge gaps)
  - 'Misuse cases': how can a hacker misuse something (i.e. hacker's user stories with ACs)
    - e.g. signing up for an account with someone else's email: confirmation emails required to prevent spoofing
    - Microsoft DREAD:
      - D: How big is the **damage**
      - R: How easy is it to **reproduce**
      - E: How easy is it to **exploit**? How much time, effort, and expertise is needed?
      - A: How many users are **affected**
      - D: How easy is it to **discover**?
  - Define black-box testing strategy (e.g. penetration testing)
    - Sending random requests and seeing what comes back (always return uniform error responses!)
- Review your threat model
  - Is new design bringing new threats or assets?
  - Is the design still in line with legislation and policies
  - Can we ensure a fail-safe state
  - What level of risk can you tolerate? $\text{risk} = {threat} \times \text{vulnerability} \times \text{cost}$

Development and coding:

- Methods and tools:
  - Linters, static code analysis
  - Dynamic code analysis (execution monitoring)
  - Secure coding practices (e.g. sanitation, encapsulation, least-privilege)
  - Fuzzing
  - Code reviews (with checklists)
- Detailed data flow analysis

Release and deployment:

- Policy compliance:
  - Specify, report on results of security activities
  - Update, review deployment infrastructure
  - Discuss with stakeholders and document
- Vulnerability scanning, continuous testing
  - Tool-supported monitoring
  - Chaos engineering: test fail-safe states
- Reporting infrastructure
  - Reporting of issues must be part of security policy
  - Reporting workflow must be clear and communicated
  - System must be monitored

[OWASP Threat Modeling Process](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process):

- Decompose the application: identify use cases, users, external dependencies etc.
- Determine, rank threats
- Determine countermeasures or mitigations
  - Accept, eliminate or mitigate risks
- Entry points act as trust boundaries
  - For each entry point, note down the different trust levels (e.g. anonymous, logged in) that can access it
- Exit points: can be used in XSS, information extraction (e.g. SQL injection)
- Assets:
  - For each asset, note down trust levels (e.g. admin, web server process, DB user)
    - Assets could be things such as login sessions (e.g. cookies)
- Threat tree:
  - Root is attack on an asset
  - Children are possible attack vectors (e.g. user did not log out)
  - Grandchildren are possible mitigations for that vector

Uber Eats Scenario:

- End-user app:
  - Contains private details, contact details, address, and bank / PayPal account
  - Order food to, review restaurants, pay via Uber Eats, can tip, and review driver
- Restaurant app:
  - Contains bank account, and business details
  - Food safety information on menu items (e.g., allergen)
  - Negotiated margin, and service fee (private to a restaurant)
  - Receive orders from end-users, authenticate, match driver and ordered food
- Driver app:
  - Receive delivery requests, can combine multiple from same restaurant
  - Can communicate to the end-users through the app
