# 05. Edge Detection

Challenge: convert a 2D image into a set of curves.

That is, find all edge points that are (mostly) connected, then join them into curves.

Edges come from:

- Surface-normal discontinuity (e.g. from shading)
- Depth discontinuity
- Surface color discontinuity
- Illumination discontinuity

Edge profiles:

```
    |-----    /\        ||
----|        /  \    ___||____
Step         Roof      Line
```

Edge detection:

- Detect short linear edge segments - *edgles*
- Aggregate edgels into extended edges

Edges are the points at which the rate of change reaches a maximum - when the second derivative is zero.

$$
\nabla f = \left[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right]
$$

The gradient, which points in the direction of greatest change, can be represented by an angle and magnitude:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} / \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right) \\

||\nabla f|| = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)^2}
$$

However, on a discrete image, approximations can be made.

The **Sobel operator**:

$$
\Delta_x = \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 1 \\
-2 & 0 & 2 \\
-1 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} \quad

\Delta_y = \begin{pmatrix}
 1 &  2 &  1 \\
 0 &  0 &  0 \\
-1 & -2 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

(NB: need to scale by $$ to get the right gradient value, but is irrelevant for edge detection)

The Robert's Cross Operator:

$$
\Delta_1 = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 & 1 \\
-1 & 0
\end{pmatrix} \quad

\Delta_2 = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &  0 \\
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The **4Ã—4 Prewitt operator**:

$$
\Delta_x = \begin{pmatrix}
-3 & -1 & 1 & 3 \\
-3 & -1 & 1 & 3 \\
-3 & -1 & 1 & 3 \\
-3 & -1 & 1 & 3
\end{pmatrix} \quad

\Delta_y = \begin{pmatrix}
 3 &  3 &  3 &  3 \\
 1 &  1 &  1 &  1 \\
-1 & -1 & -1 & -1 \\
-3 & -3 & -3 & -3 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Looking at only the adjacent pixel may be useless in situations with large amounts of noise. Hence, use a Gaussian kernel to smooth the image before applying the gradient operator. However, this can be done more efficiently by applying the *derivative function to the Gaussian kernel*, then applying it to the signal (the derivative theorem of convolution).

Then, the point of maximum difference - the second differential, can be found to detect the edge.

Optimal edge detection should have:

- Good detection: responds to edges, not noise
- Good localization: detected edge is close to the true edge
- TODO
- More smoothing = better detection but worse localization

optimal detector: approximately the derivative of the gaussian.

## Scale Space

As \phi ? gets larger, blurring increases TODO - the reoslution of the image gets smaller.

Generate image with multiple values of \phi.

Find first derivative peaks across all versions of the image - connect across images. The point at which the first derivatie peaks disppears/is too small can be used to quantify how strong the edge is.


## line detection

line = a bunch of edges that form a mostly-continuous line

Hough transform - straight line detection


For curves: works with any curve that can be expressed in parametric form. Parameter space gets huge.


### Corners

What is the gradient at the corner? going in two different directions. Hence, edge detectors tend to fail at corners

But useful for tracking movement between frames.
