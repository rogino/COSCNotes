Structural processing of images

From ~1960s

- Erosion: shrinks objects
- Dilation: expands objects
- Open: erode then dilate
  - Smooths images, removing small spurs, lines and noise
- Close: dilate then erode
  - Fills gaps and holes while preserving thin lines

Extracting quantitative descriptions of image components:

- Boundaries
- Skeletons
- Convex hulls

Pixels are either object or non-object pixels.

*Structuring element*: smaller matrix applied to the image

Binary erode:

- $A \otimes B = \{x: B_x \subseteq A \}$
- Structuring element placed centered around every pixel: remove if any pixel of the structuring element overlaps with a non-object pixel

Binary dilation:

- $A \otimes B = \{x: \hat{B_x} \cap A \neq \empty \}$
- Keep any pixels covered by the structuring element when placed at at least one location

Greyscale erode:

- Replace set operation with $\text{min}$ operation
- $D_G(A, B) = \min_{[j, k] \in B}{\{a[m - j, n - k], b[j, k]\}}$

Greyscale dilate:

- $D_G(A, B) = \max_{[j, k] \in B}{\{a[m - j, n - k], b[j, k]\}}$

Distance transform:

- Minimum distance of each pixel to non-object pixel
- Simple but inefficient: repeat erosion operation until all pixels gone; distance is the number of erosion operations required before the pixel disappeared
- Structuring element:
  - Chessboard: pixels sharing corners or edges are both have a distance of 1. 3 by 3 square structuring element
  - Manhattan: 3 by 3 cross structuring element

Skeleton transform:

- Reduces regions to one-pixel line thick borders
- Methods:
  - Distance transform: create by finding pixels with a distance of 1
  - Thinning: repeatedly thin image, retaining end points/connections

Convex hull:

- Follow outlines of object, except concavities
