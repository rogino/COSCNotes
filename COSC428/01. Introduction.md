# 01. Introduction

Weighting:

- 50%: research project presented as a conference style paper, including a relevant literature review (due week 8)
  - Automatic timecode/GPS coordinate extraction from dashcam/surveilance cameras?
- 10%: class participation/presentations (presentations in final weeks of semester)
- 40%: final exam

Goal: to recognize objects and their motions.

Signal processing on 1D data; computer vision on 2D data.

Image processing on still images; computer vision on video and still images.

## Difficulties

The **sensory gap**: gap between reality and what a recording of the scene can capture.

The **semantic gap**: lack of contextual knowledge about a scene.

The human visual system is **very good**:

- ~50% of cerebral cortex used for vision
- Emualating the operation of human behaviours:
  - Perception based on relative brightness (e.g. [Checker shadow illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_shadow_illusion))
  - Logarithmic response to brightness
  - Low-light performance (for passive systems)

## Recovering 3D information

Several cues available:

- Motion
- Stereo (< 3m)
- Texture
- Shading
- Contours

Or actual depth hardware:

- Active stereo (IR - brightness limited for safety)
- Structured light: dot projection
- Time of flight
  - RF-modulated
  - Direct timing (LIDAR)
    - Brightness not limited as eye exposure duration so short

Labs: Intel Realsense D435.

## Processing

- Pre-processing: noise reduction, contrast etc.
- Low-level: color, boundary/edge, shape, texture detection
- High-level: object detection, determining spatial relationships, meanings

The higher-level the processing, the less generic and the more domain-specific knowledge is required.

Low-Level Image Processing:

- Image compression
- Noise reduction (while maximizing information kept)
- Edge extraction
- Contrast enhancement (only helps humans)
- Segmentation
- Thresholding
- Morphology
- Image restoration (e.g. deblurring using knowledge of speed of subject)

### Approaches

- Build a simple model of the world; constain the environment (e.g. fixed lighting environment)
  - Focus on definite tasks with clear requirements
- Find provably good algorithms
  - Try ideas based on theory
- Experiment on real world
  - Solutions may not generalize to a more complex environment
- Update the model
