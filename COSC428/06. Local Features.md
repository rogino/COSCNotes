# 06. Local Features

Scale and rotation invariant descriptors.

Correspondence using window matching: if points are used, it is highly ambiguous.

## Stereo Cameras

Baseline: distance between cameras. Wider baseline allows greater accuracy further away, while a smaller baseline allows overlap at closer distances. Increased camera resolution can increase depth resolution overall.

Rectification: transform of images onto a common image plane (i.e. sensor, but inverted). The image planes of the two cameras must be parallel

Correspondence using window matching:

- For each window and for every pixel offset, determine how well the two match; minimum will give you the pixel offset and thus distance
- For window of size $m \times m$:

  $$
  W_m(x, y) = \left\{ u, v \vert
    x - \frac{m}{2} \le u \le x + \frac{m}{2},
    y - \frac{m}{2} \le v \le y + \frac{m}{2}
  \right\}
  $$
- Matching metric: sum of squared pixel differences
  - $_r(x, y, d) = \sum_{(u, v) \in W_m(x, y)}{\left[I_L(u, v) - I_R(u - d, v)\right]^2}$

Image normalization: variation in sensor gain/sensitivity means normalization is recommended.

Window magnitude:
$$
\left\Vert I \right\Vert_{W_m(x, y)} = \sqrt{\sum_{(u, v) \in W_m(x, y)}{\left[I(u, v)\right]^2}}
$$

Average:

$$
\bar{I} = \frac{1}{\vert W_m(x, y) \vert}\sum_{(u, v) \in W_m(x, y)}{I(u, v)}
$$

Normalized pixel:

$$
\hat{I}_{(x, y)} = \frac{I(x, y) - \bar{I}}{\left\Vert I - \bar{I}\right\Vert_{W_m(x, y)}}
$$

Vectorization: convert matrix into vector by unwrapping: horizontal lines together. Denote as $\omega$.

Normalization scales magnitude of the $m^2$-dimensional space into unit length. Two metrics possible for comparing two windows: distance and angle.

Distance ((normalized) sum of squared differences);

$$
C_\textrm{SSD}(d) = \Vert \omega_L - \omega_R(d) \Vert^2
$$

$\omega_R(d)$ is window centered around $(x - d, y)$)

Normalized correlation:

$$
C_\textrm{NC}(d) = \omega_L \cdot \omega_R(d) = \cos(\theta)
$$

## Local Features

Aperture problem and normal flow: if you only have a partial view of a moving, one-dimensional object, you cannot always tell how it is moving (e.g. a moving line whose ends are outside the viewport)
n.

Given velocities $u$ and $v$ and partial derivatives $I_x$, $I_y$ and $I_t$ for a given pixel, the brightness change constraint equation (BCCE), which states that brightness should stay constant for a given point over time, can be approximated (1st order Taylor series) as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_xu + I_yv + I_t &= 0 \\
\nabla I \cdot \vec{U} &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Normal flow, the vector representing translation of the line in the direction in the direction of its normal, can be written as:

$$
u_\perp = - \frac{I_t}{\vert \nabla I \vert} \frac{\nabla I}{\vert \nabla I \vert}
$$

By considering multiple moving points, the velocity $U$ can be found:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla I^1 \cdot U &= -I_t^1 \\
\nabla I^2 \cdot U &= -I_t^2 \\
\dots
\end{aligned}
$$

### Lucas-Kanade

Assumes the same velocity for all pixels within the window, and that pixel intensities do not change between frames.

https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.0/d4/dee/tutorial_optical_flow.html

$$
E(u, v) = \sum_{x, y \in \Omega}{
  \left(
    I_x(x, y)u + I_y(x, y)v + I_t
  \right)^2
}
$$

Solve using:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  \sum{I_x^2}     & \sum{I_x I_y} \\
  \sum{I_x I_y}   & \sum{I_y^2}   \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} u \\ v \end{pmatrix} =
-\begin{pmatrix}
  \sum{I_x I_t} \\
  \sum{I_y I_t}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

LHS: sum of outer product tensor of gradient vector

$$
\left( \sum{\nabla I \nabla I^T} \right) \vec{U} = -\sum{\nabla I I_t}
$$

Good features:

- Satisfy brightness constancy
- Has sufficient texture variation
- But not too much texture variation - too many edges is also a problem as it is hard to tell how the
- Corresponds to a 'real' surface patch (e.g. shadows not real)
- Does not deform too much over time

Previous equation can be written as $\bold{A}\vec{u} = -\vec{b}$.

For this to be solvable:

- $\bold{A}$ should be invertible
- $\bold{A}$ should not be too small - signal to noise ratio
  - Eigenvalues $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ should not be too small
- $\bold{A}$ should be *well-conditioned*
  - $\lambda_1 / \lambda_2$ should not be too large (where $\lambda_1$ is the larger eigenvalue)
- Original scoring function: $R = \lambda 1 \lambda 2 - k(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2)^2$
- Shi-Tomasi scoring function: $R = \text{min}(\lambda_1, \lambda_2) > c$

### Harris Detector

Using auto-correlation on 'interesting' points - where there are important differences in all directions.

For a point $(x, y)$ and shift $(\Delta x, \Delta y)$, the auto-correlation is:

$$
f(x, y) \sum_{(x_k, y_k) \in W}{
  \left(
    I(x_k, y_k) - I(
      x_k + \Delta x,
      y_k + \Delta y
    )
  \right)^2
}
$$

Avoiding discrete shifts:

$$
I(x_k + \Delta x, y_k + \Delta y) = I(x_k, y_k) +
  \begin{pmatrix}I_x(x_k, y_k) & I_y(x_k, y_k) \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}\Delta x \\ \Delta y \end{pmatrix}
$$

$$
f(x, y) = \sum_{(x_k, y_k) \in W}{
  \left(
    \begin{pmatrix}I_x(x_k, y_k) & I_y(x_k, y_k) \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}\Delta x \\ \Delta y \end{pmatrix}
  \right)^2
}
$$

Auto-correlation matrix:

$$
= \begin{pmatrix}\Delta x & \Delta y\end{pmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  \sum_{(x_k, y_k) \in W}{\left(I_x(x_k, y_k)\right)^2} &
  \sum_{(x_k, y_k) \in W}{I_x(x_k, y_k) I_y(x_k, y_k)} \\
  \sum_{(x_k, y_k) \in W}{I_x(x_k, y_k) I_y(x_k, y_k)} &
  \sum_{(x_k, y_k) \in W}{\left((I_y(x_k, y_k)\right)^2}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}\Delta x \\ \Delta y\end{pmatrix}
$$

The matrix captures the structure of the local neighborhood. Interest can be measured using the matrix's eigenvalues:

- 2 strong eigenvalues: interesting point
- 1 strong eigenvalue: contour
- 0 eigenvalue: uniform regions

Interest point detection can be done using thresholding, or a local maximum for localization.

Feature distortion:

- Model as Affine transforms: parallel lines preserved
- OpenCV `findFeatures`
- Affine transforms:
  - $u(x, y) = a_1 + a_2x + a_3y$
  - $v(x, y) = a_4 + a_5x + a_6y$
  - Six parameters, min. six pixels per window
  - Pass into BCCE and minimize error

## Invariant Local Features

Local features that are invariant to translation, rotation, scale etc.. They should have:

- Locality: features are local; robust to occlusion/clutter
- Distinctiveness: individual features can be matched to a large database of objects
- Quantity: even small projects should have features
- Efficiency: close to real-time performance
- Extensibility: can be extended for a wide range of differing feature types

SIFT: Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT).

- Scale invariance:
  - Gaussian pyramid
    - Blur then halve the dimensions (one octave)
    - Compute Difference of Gaussian (DoG): difference between neighboring Gaussian layers
      - Approximation of Laplacian of Gaussian
    - Compare pixel against 8 neighbors in same scale, plus against 9 neighbors in the DoG one octave above/below: use as keypoint if a minimum/maximum across all 26 neighbors
- Rotation invariance:
  - Create histogram of local (i.e. neighbor pixel) gradient directions; each bin covers 10 degrees
  - Canonical orientation = peak of histogram
- Descriptor:
  - 16x16 region in scale space around keypoint
  - Rotate region to match canonical orientation
  - Create orientation histograms on 4x4 pixel neighborhoods; 8 bins/orientations each
  - Hence 16 neighborhoods with 8 bins each: 128 element vector
