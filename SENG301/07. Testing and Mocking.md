## Objectives

Testing shows the *presence* of bugs, not their absences.

Two main objectives:

- Validation: check that the software fulfils its requirements
- Verification: identifying erroneous behaviour

Determine if it is fit for purpose:

- Purpose: is it safety critical? Go through formal validation
- Expectations: do users expect it to be polished?
- Marketing: time-to-market and prices

## Staged Testing

Run unit tests, then component tests, then system tests (scenario-based user testing).

### Unit Testing

- Every feature should be **testable** and **tested**
  - Each piece of code should be *self-sufficient*
- Use fake/simulated inputs
- Avoid human/third-party interactions

Methods should also prevent missuses:

- Regression tests
- Explicit verifications of pre/post conditions at component boundaries

Be sceptical:

- Identify domains for values that should have the same effects
- Consider edge cases (boundaries of domains)

### Component Testing

Various types of interfaces:

- Application behaviour through operations such as method calls
- Shared memory between processes
- Messages being passed through some communication medium

Be skeptical of input data:

- Make components fail (differing failures - stop failures from cascading between components)
- Stress testing (e.g. message overflow)
- If a call order exists, try call operations in a different order

### System Testing

- Integrate third party components/systems
- Should be performed by dedicated testers, or at least, not only developers

Scenario-based testing:

- Main usages (full interaction flows)
- Tests should touch all layers (e.g. the GUI)

Trace and record test executions in **some structured way**:

- Input values, expected output, observed output
- Include metadata like who, when, issue IDs 

## Agile Testing

For each commit run:

- Automated unit tests
- Automated story tests

Peer reviews should also be done before merging.

**Any successful builds should become a release candidate.**

Run manual tests on candidate at end of each sprint.

Run automated performance tests before each release.

Assertion clauses:

- Check parameter values
- Ensure invariants are actually invariants
- Useful for regression testing

Guideline-based testing identifies common programming mistakes (e.g. null values) and ensures tests are performed on these aspects.

### Acceptance Test-Driven Development

User stories accompanied by acceptance criteria.

To automate the tests:

- Define application interfaces; isolate the UI
- Use dependency injection (inversion of control)
- Fake minimal implementations for dependencies (stubs) or databases
- Split asynchronous scenarios into synchronous ones
- Fake time where possible (e.g. latency, scheduling)

### Automated Acceptance Tests

Use the same path as the users; playback tools like Selenium test directly on the GUI, but may be fragile and time-consuming.

Hence, decoupling the UI from business logic is useful.

Acceptance criteria can be tested using Cucumber.

### Sprint Reviews

Prepare and plan sprint reviews:

- Ensure acceptance criteria are all running
  - Acts as a last-minute verification test (smoke tests)
- May need to rework some stories
  - Prefer rolling back to previous candidate rather than fixing bugs

### Capacity, Load and Stress Testing

Quality requirements are often difficult to test (e.g. maintainability, auditability are not testable).

Capacity-focused requirements can be tested in a semi-automated fashion: response time can be expressed as user stories or as required system features.
