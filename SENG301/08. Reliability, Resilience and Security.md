# 08. Reliability, Resilience and Security

## Ethics

Equality: same treatment for everybody

Equity: customized treatment to ensure everyone has the same opportunity

Algorithms and AI: garbage in, garbage out. If the dataset it is fed is biased, the output will be biased.

ACM code of ethics. TL;DR: respect everyone + make mistakes and reflect on your mistakes.

## Reliability and Resilience

Faults, errors and failures:

- Human error: invalid input data causing the system to misbehave
- System fault: something that leads to an error
- System error: visible effects of misbehaviour
- System failure: when system returns bad results

To improve reliability:

- Fault avoidance: design, development process, tools and guidelines
- Detection and correction: test, debug, validate
- Fault tolerance: designing system to handle/recover from failures

Availability and reliability:

- Availability: probability of being able to successfully access the system
- Reliability: probability of failure-free operation

*Works-as-designed* problem:

- System specification may be wrong (not reflecting user truth)
- System specification erroneous (typos, not proof-read etc.)

Reliability can be subjective, affecting only a subset of users:

- Errors can be concentrated in a specific part of the system
- Responses may be slow at a specific time or location

Capacity management:

- Thing carefully about software architecture, especially for I/O
- Ues threads carefully (starvation and deadlocks)
- Write dedicated tests and monitor production systems

Architectural strategies:

- Protection systems
  - Systems that monitor the execution of others
  - Trigger alarms or automatically correct the behaviour
- Multiversion programming
  - Concurrent computation
    - Hardware with different items/providers
    - Software with different development teams
    - Voting systems e.g. triple-modular-redundancy

### Reliability Guidelines

- Visibility: need-to-know principle; if variables/methods don't need to be exposed, don't expose them
- Validity:
  - Check format and domain of input values (inclding boundaries)
  - Use if statements or *regression-test-enabled* assert statements
- Avoid errors becoming system failures by *capturing* them; never send back an error message with the stack trace
- Erring:
  - Avoid untyped languages
  - Encapsulate 'nasty' stuff
- Restart: provide *recoverable milestones* so that it can restart into a good state
- Constants: express fixed or real-world values with meaningful names

Unicorns:

Security treats come from:

- Ignorance: unknown risks
- Design: security is disregarded
- Carelessness: bad design
- Trade-offs: lack of emphasis on security

## The Four Rs of a Resilience Engineering Plan

- **Recognition**: how an attacker may target an asset
- **Resistance**: possible strategies to resist each threat
- **Recovery**: plan data, software and hardware recovery procedures
  - And test the restore procedure
- **Reinstatement**: define the process to bring the system back

Resilience planning:

- Identify resilience requirements: minimum functionality while being attacked
- Backup and reinstatement procedures
- Classifying critical assets; how should they work in degraded mode
- Test it! An untested backup is as bad as no backup

Checklist:

- Permissions: ensure file, user permissions are correct
- Session: terminate long-running, inactive user sessions
- Overflows: take care around memory overflows
- Password: require strong passwords
- Input: sanitize inputs
