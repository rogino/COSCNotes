# 04. Agile Team Management

## Servant Leadership

- **Empathy**: understand and share feelings of team members/stakeholders
- **Awareness**: aware of impacts of their decisions/behavior
- **Community**: maintains a feeling of membership
- **Persuasion**: dialogue instead of coercion or commanding
- **Conceptualization**: focus on the big picture; trust in your team for daily tasks
- **Growth**: develop everyone's skills

The scrum master should help, not direct, their team:

- Drop the ego
- Act fairly towards all team members
- Should be confident and humble
- Be accessible

## Archetype of a Scrum Master

The scrum master should empower communication:

- Between team members and stakeholders
- Between engineering and marketing
- Inside the team

They also need to protect the team when necessary; act as a shield to ensure the team can be successful.

They should refrain from jumping into **technical details**:

- Trust in the team
- Do not rescue team members too quickly
- Avoid technical discussions during planning

## Team Organization

- Recognize everyone as an **individual** while ensuring there is **collaboration** within the team.
- Everyone is a developer and does everything
  - Work on different parts of the system
- Have some specializations; work on your **core technical competencies**, but also be competent in other fields:
  - Ensure there is **continuous knowledge transfer**
    - This ensures your team is resilient to unexpected losses
    - **Bus factor**: what's the **smallest number of people that can get hit by a bus** before your the project fails due to lack of knowledge/experience
  - Developers should work outside their comfort zone

## Agenda

Sprint planning:

- Ensure everyone knows their availability
  - People may be working on other projects
  - Check all **deadlines for other courses**
- Interruptions, team communication etc. is time consuming

Create an agenda:

- Don't rely on memory alone
- Put all deadlines on the agenda
- Bring it to all planning sessions
- Make **non-negotiable times clear** at the beginning of the project
  - Times where you will not reply even if the server is on fire

### Changes

The sprint plan should be protected: decisions were made with the PO and should not be changed on a whim.

Stakeholders may come at any time and ask for:

- Small **cosmetic** changes; superficial makeup
- New **functional** changes; stories that should be estimated and planned

The developer must know the threshold between the two and communicate with the stakeholders:

- Ask if the added makeup worth it
- Decide whether the story can be added to the developer's buffer

### Issues and Bugs

**Issues**: problem identified before a review at the latest.

**Bug**: problem discovered at the earliest during later **regression** tests; these **must** be added to the **backlog**.

High priority bugs may be taken into account during the current sprint. This requires **discussion with the PO** (as items are being re-prioritized).

If direct communication is used instead of formal reports, ensure **reproduction steps are communicated**.

### Impediments

- **Long meetings**: stick to essential stakeholders; keep them time-boxed
- **Illness**: don't come, plz
- **Broken builds**: especially with CI/CD, this becomes the top priority and interrupts the whole team
- **Tools**: if you don't have the right tools you can't develop
- **Third parties**: consider alternatives or work-arounds
- **Scope creep**: review stories and tasks thoroughly to reduce the amount of creep
- **Unreliable PO**: can't get rid of them, so form strategies to deal with them
- **Team problems**: use retrospectives and involve the scrum master as soon as possible. Don't let the problem grow
- **External incentives**: plan around clubs and other life priorities/responsibilities

Record **traces** of all issues for sprint reviews and retrospectives so that the team can learn from it if you face the issue again. See [https://xkcd.com/979/](Wisdom of the Ancients)

### Bad Behavior Patterns

- Taking over everyone's jobs
- Command: controlling everyone's jobs
- Public blaming and shaming
- Siloing: specializing into one aspect; low bus factor
- Poor code quality practices

Reactive behaviors:

- Fear: failure is an option
- Pressure: adding more buggy features on top of a poorly-built base
- Experiment: run spikes when necessary
- Urgency: fire-fighting is exhausting
