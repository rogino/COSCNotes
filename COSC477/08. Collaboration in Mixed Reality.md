# 08. Collaboration in Mixed Reality

Tuckman's model of group formation:

1. Forming
  - Orientating themselves around the task at hand
  - Become acquainted with each other
  - Testing group behaviors
  - Establishing common viewpoints, values
  - Establishing initial ground rules
2. Storming
  - Marked by intense team conflicts
  - Leadership and roles determined
  - Project and tasks redefined
  - Characteristics:
    - Disagreements
    - Resistance to task demands
    - Venting of disagreements
    - High level of uncertainty about the goals
3. Norming
  - Team roles cleared up
  - Agreement on how the team can work with each other
  - Clear expectations and consensus on group behaviors and norms
  - Consensus on group goals, quality standards
  - Forming the basis for behavior for the remainder of the project
4. Performing
  - Active work on a project
  - Clearly understood roles, tasks, and well-defined norms
  - Sufficient interest and energy from all team members
5. Adjourning
  - Dissolution of the team: team tasks are accomplished and the team disbands
  - Possible feelings of regret

Drexler's team performance model:

1. Orientation: why I am here?
2. Trust building: who are you?
3. Goal clarification: what are we doing?
4. Commitment: how are we doing it?
5. Implementation: who does what, when, where?
6. High performance
7. Renewal

## Collaboration

Definitions

- Wood and Gray, 1991: a process that occurs when a group of stakeholders engage in an **interactive process** using **shared rules, norms and structures** to act or decided on issues related to that domain
- Terveen, 1995: a process in which two or more **agents** work together to achieve a shared goal
- Knoll and Lukosch, 2013: an interactive process in which a group of individual group members use **shared rules, norms and structures** to create or share knowledge in order to perform a collaborative task


### Designing collaboration

Collaboration is affected by internal and external factors:

- The group: size, proximity, experience
- Task: type and complexity
- Context: organizational culture and environment
- Process: interactive process, shared rules, norms
- Tools: technology and their limitations

Collaboration outcomes:

- Creative ideas for activities
- Shared understanding
- Commitment
- Consensus
- Sharing perspectives and visions
- More objective evaluation
- Acceptance
- Mutual learning
- Shared responsibility

e.g. using AR to help people understand impacts of climate change.

### Collaboration Challenges

Piirainen et al., 2012 - group perspective:

- Shared understanding:
  - Ensure the team has a shared understanding and mental models of:
    - The problem
    - The current state of the system
    - The envisioned solution
- Satisfying quality requirements/constraints
- Balancing rigor and relevance
  - The more formal the process, the slower you go but the more you can involve and understand stakeholders
- Organizing and ensuring effective, efficient interaction between actors
- Ensuring ownership
  - Team members must pick up tasks and take ownership of them

Nunamaker et al. 1997 - process perspective:

- Free riding
  - Especially in larger groups
- Dominance
  - Both the amount of work done and of decision-making power
- Group think
- Hidden agenda
- Fixed design
  - Process limits the design space the group can explore
- Lack of expert facilitators

Haake et al., 2010 and Olson and Olson, 2000 - tool perspective:

- Google Docs, email, video conferencing, etc.
- No regular use
- Variety
- Not intuitive
- Difficult to adapt to group needs
- Collaboration awareness
  - Being aware of when other people have made changes
- Co- and spatial referencing

## Collaboration Design from a Tool Perspective

Time-space matrix of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW):

- Same place, same time (synchronous interaction): face-to-face interaction
- Same place, different time (asynchronous interaction): shared files, team rooms etc.
- Different place, same time (synchronous distributed): video calls, shared editors etc.
- Different place, different place (asynchronous distributed): email, newsgroups etc.

In AR:

- Synchronous, co-located: AR shared space
- Synchronous, remote: AR telepresence
- Asynchronous, co-located: AR annotations/browsing (in-situ)
- Asynchronous, remote: generic sharing

3C model:

- Communication: information exchange to facilitate a shared understanding
- Coordination: arranging task-oriented activities
- Collaboration: working together towards a shared goal
- Group awareness mediates relation: none of the other 3Cs are possible without it

### Human-Computer-Human Interaction Design

- Software design: software interacts with other software
- Human-computer interaction design: humans interacting with computers
- Human-computer-human interaction design: several humans in front of several computing devices working together towards a shared task
  - Computers must interact with each other, and humans must interact with each other as well


Oregon Software Development Process (OSDP) (Lukosch, 2007):

- Oregon Experiment, Christopher Alexander:
  - University campus did not put down any footpaths initially, but waited to see what trails the students would make
- Patterns for computer-mediated interaction:
  - High-level patterns:
    - Focus on issues and solutions targeted at end users
    - Empower end users to shape their groupware application
  - Low-level patterns:
    - Describe issues/solutions targeted at software developers
    - Focus on system implementation and includes technical details
  - Example: remote field of vision
    - Collaborative whiteboard/canvas: need to know where team members are and where they are looking at
    - Possible solution: multi-user scrollbar (multiple narrow scrollbars)
      - Understand where their team members are both globally and relative to themselves
      - Users can see roughly how much of their screen space intersects with another user's, and where
- Iterations follow design -> implementation -> test/usage -> planning cycle
- Conceptual iteration
  - Talking to users, understanding the problem space, creating prototypes
  - Use of patterns to discuss high-level ideas with users
  - Developers use the low-level patterns tODO
- Development iteration: TODO
  - Requirements analysis
  - Low-level patterns used to plan and design groupware
  - Functional tests
- Tailoring iteration:
  - Users have used the prototypes and have provided feedback

## Workspace Awareness in Collaborative AR

Types:

- Informal awareness:
  - General sense of who is around and what they are up to
  - Not necessarily related to project work
- Social awareness:
  - Understanding of the person:
    - What they are interested in
    - Their emotional state
    - What they are paying attention to
- Group-structural awareness:
  - Knowledge about the group structure:
    - Roles/responsibilities/status
    - Positions on issues
    - Group processes
- Workspace awareness:
  - Understanding of the task space
  - Interaction of others with the space and its artifacts

Awareness categories and elements:

- Who:
  - Presence: is anyone in the workspace?
  - Identity: who is participating?
  - Authorship: who is doing that?
- What:
  - Action: what are they doing?
  - Intention: what is their goal?
    - They are doing *x* in order to achieve *y*
  - Artifact: what object are they working on
- Where:
  - Location: where are they working?
  - Gaze: where are they looking?
  - View: where can they see?
  - Reach: where can they reach?
    - Can children or short people access it?

Workspace awareness:

- Knowledge: who/what/when/when/how
  - is used to determine what to look for next
- Exploration
  - is used to gather perceptual information
- The environment
  - aids in interpreting the perceptual information
- Knowledge
- is used to help with collaboration
  - Coordination of activities
  - Anticipation of events
- which impacts the environment

### Case Studies

[Workspace awareness in collaborative AR](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41133-016-0003-x):

- Remote expert can see what the player can see and give hints on how to complete the puzzle
- Expert given a gray box which represents the size of the Hololen's display
- Expert can freeze the view:
  - View is continually changes, which makes it difficult to focus
  - Hence, they should be able to freeze the view (and annotate it), possibly in a separate window
- The remote person must be able to communicate to the local person that they have made changes or annotated something: workspace awareness
- They can, of course, talk, but the paper tried adding automatic notifications:
  - Aural: TTS when the remote user adds/selects/deletes and object, or when they freeze/unfreeze the view
  - Visual: small blinking icon
- Results:
  - Audio is much more noticeable, but also more annoying
  - Participants preferred visual notifications

[A collaborative game to study presence and situational awareness in a physical and an augmented reality environment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303735558_A_collaborative_game_to_study_presence_and_situational_awareness_in_a_physical_and_an_augmented_reality_environment):

- Game played in two environments (physical/augmented reality)
- Investigate how a remote person can try to help a local team
- Three players had to build a Lego tower following certain constraints:
  - Each player has access to a subset of the constraints
  - Each player could only move certain-colored blocks
    - But also some blocks that everyone could move
- Two players co-located, one player remote
  - Co-located users wearing HMDs, remote user viewing laptop
- The same group also played it physically (with randomized order)
- Asked AR presence questionnaire:
  - Interaction/immersion
  - Interference/distraction
  - Audio/tactile experiment
  - Moving in environment
- Results:
  - Mental demand not significantly different
  - Physical demand in AR higher
    - Finger has to hover in midair
  - Slower in AR
  - Presence:
    - Interaction in AR much more difficult, and impacts concentration
    - Difficult for remote player to understand and foresee the other people's actions
    - Co-located AR players reported tactile experience (even though it was completely virtual)

CSI The Hague:

- Collaboration with Hague police circa. 2009
- Special skills required to secure evidence
- Need to capture evidence early on, but collector is likely not an expert
- Expert could remotely help the on-site person
- Video see-through HMD
- Two webcams used for SLAM:
  - 3D pose estimation
  - Dense 3D map
    - Remote user could explore the space in VR
- Bare hand tracking for gesture-based interaction
- Evaluation:
  - Lack of protocol for collaboration
  - High mutual understanding
  - Picture-oriented information exchange
  - High consensus: both parties can see the same video stream
- Data integrity: how do you ensure it has not been modified
- Responsibility: if the crime scene gets messed up, who is responsible - the local person or the expert?

Burkhardt et al., 2009: seven dimensions of collaboration:

- Fluidity of collaboration: verbal turns (cues?)/actions
- Sustaining mutual understanding
- Information exchange for problem-solving
- Argumentation and reaching consensus
- Task/time management
- Cooperative/collaborative spirit in the team
- Awareness of their individual tasks and contribution
