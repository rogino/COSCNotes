## Data Visualization in Mixed Reality

Immersive analytics (Immersive Analytics, Springer, 2018):

- Coping with the ever-increasing amount and complexity of data around us that surpasses our ability to understand/utilize in decision-making:
  - Business analysis
  - Science
  - Policy making
  - General public (e.g. personalized health data)
- Removing barriers between people, their data and tools used for analysis
- Support data understanding and decision-making everywhere by everyone

- TODO
- Builds upon:
  - Data visualization
  - Visual analytics
  - VR/AR
  - Computer graphics
  - HCI

Very dependent on availability of immersive technologies:
- HMDs for AR/VR
- Large wall-mounted, hand-held or wearable displays
- ML to interpret user gestures/utterance

Immersive analytics allows engagement:

- With wider audience through tools/technologies that more fully engage the senses
- With a new generation whose primary input device is not the mouse/keyboard
- In situations are desktop computing is impossible
- In groups where all participants are equally empowered

Opportunties:

- Situated analytices
  - User-controlled data anlytics linked wit objects in the physical world
    - Energy consumption
    - Construction progress
    - Supermarket (e.g. nutritional value of foods, comparison)
    - TODO
- Embodied data exploration
  - Touch/gesture/voice/TUI for more intuitive/engaging data exploration
  - TODO
- TODO
- Spatial immersion: 3D (or 2.5D) rather than 2D visualization
- Multi-sensory presentation
  - Beyond visual/audio (e.g. haptics)
  - Augmented cognition
- Engagement in data-informed decision making
  - Involve general public/other stakeholders
  - TODO immersive interactive narrative visualizations


### Possible Values of 3D for Data Visualziations

Additional visual channel (3rd spatial dimension) for data visualization:

- Prone to occlusion, depth disparity, foreshortening
- Studies demonstrate some benefits to this channel

Immersive display technologies have advanced considerably: higher resolution, lower latency, wider range of interaction technologies

Immersive workspaces:

- Use the space around you as a workspace
- Place data visualizations where you want, anchored to the physical space (or relative to your position)
- Beylond task effectiveness:
  - Focus not on accuracy/speed
  - Does spatial immersion support deeper collaboration or greater engagement?
- TODO

### Depth Cues and Display Technology

- Linear perspective:
  - Consequence of the projective properties of the eye as a sensor:
  - Occlusion: objects closer in space prevent us from seeing objects behind it
  - Foreshortening
    - Relative size: two objects of the same size at different distances from the observers project differently
    - Relative density: spatial patterns of objects/visual features appear denser as the distance to the pattern increases
    - Height in visual fields:
     - Objects are bound to rest on the ground
     - Bottom of objects can be used as a reference
- Aerial perspective: changes in color properties of objects at large distances
- Motion perspective: moving object/observers provide information about 3D structure
- Binocular disparity/stereopsis: small differences in the images received by the left/right eye
- Accommodation (depth of field):
  - Effects of dynamic physiological changes in the shape of each eye
  - Amount of blur of the background and other objects provides information about their relative distance
  - Dependent on the lightness of the scene
- Depth cues:
  - Shadows
    - Cue for judging the height of an object above the plane
    - Useful for floating objects
  - Convergence
    - Reflex of the visual system: change in rotation of the eyes that takes place to align the object/region of interest in the center of the eyes' fovea
    - TODO
- Controlled point of view
  - Ability to manipulate the point of view in a virtual space
  - User knows positional changes, expects visual changes
  - Relies on touch/proprioception
  - Complementary to visual cues
  - e.g. moving joystick
- Subjective motion
  - Actual physical motion in the space of the observer
  - Information through the vestibular system (balance, movement detection)
  - Complementary to visual cues
- Object manipuation
  - Change position of objects with respect to the observer
  - Trigger motion perspective, changes in other cues
  - Does not trigger vestibular TODO

Limitations of depth persception:

- 30% of popuatlion may experience binocular deficiency
- Binocular acuity decreases with age
- Line-of-sight ambiguity: rays can only intersect once (occlusion)
- Text legibility
  - Low resolution of HMDs
  - Foreshortening, 3D orientation

### Comparing 2D with 3D Representations - Potential Benefits of Immersive Visualization

Cone Trees:

- Indented lists/tree structures in 3D, where nodes are arranged in a cone that you can rotate
- Linear perspective provides a focus+context view of the tree
- 3D cues of perspective, lighting, shadows help with understanding
- More effective use of display space
- Interactive animation reduces cognitive load
- Study results:
  - Poor representation for hierarchical data: occlusion, slow tree rotation
  - May help in improving understanding of the underlying structure

Data mountains:

- Arrange documents on a virtual 3D desktop
- More objectives on the desktop
  - Linear perspective provides focus + context view
- Natural metaphor for grouping
- Leverages 3D spatial memory
- Study results:
  - 2D data mountains outperformed 3D, although participants thought otherwise
  - 2.5D data (2D + linear perspective) outperform 2D
  - i.e. 3D < 2D < 2.5D

Aviation:

- Show position and predicted flight path in 3D
- Study results:
  - Better for lateral/altitude flight path tracking
  - Worse for accurate measurement of airspeed
  - ATC found it worse for everything other than collision avoidance

3D shapes/landscapes:

- 3D better for:
- Understanding the overall shape
- Approximate navigation and relative positioning
- 2D better for precise manipulation


Network visualization:

- 3D better for judging if there is a path between highlighted nodes
- Motion cues beneficial for:
  - Path following in 3D mazes
  - Viewing graphs in AR
- Egocentric spherical layout of 3D graph with HMD outperforms 2D for:
  - Finding common neighbors
  - Finding paths
  - Recalling node location

Multivariate data visualization:

- 3D scatter plots better for:
  - Distance comparisons
  - Outlier detection
  - Cluster identification and shape identification
  - Answering integrative questions

Spatial and spatio-temporal data visualization:

- 2D vs 3D representations in VR:
  - Exocentric: globe in front of view
  - Egocentric: standing inside globe
  - Flat map
  - Curved map around the user
  - Exocentric globe more accurate for distance comparison and estimation
  - More time required for task completion compared to maps

Overall:

- Clusters/other structures may be clearer in 3D
- Sufficient depth cues required for the viewer to see clusters
- 3D may benefit path following
- Binocular 'pop-out' may be beneficial for highlighting elements
- Using the 3rd dimension to show time is a successful idiom

Summary:

- 3D not generally better than 2D
- 3D may show overall structures in multi-dimensional spaces better
- 2D preferable for precise manipulation or accurate data value measurement
- Choice of technology and depth cues can make a significant difference to the effectiveness:
  - Binocular presentation, head-tracking increased spatial judgment accuracy
  - TODO

### Data Visualization in AR - Situated Analytics

- Data visualizations integrated into the physical environment
- Needs to take into account the existence of the physical world
- Examples:
  - Supermarket (e.g. viewing detailed product information, price comparison)
  - Attendees at a conference (e.g. displaying name, affiliation)
  - Machinery in a lab (e.g. showing progress)
  - Objects at a building site

Conceptual model:

- The *raw data* and the *visualization pipeline* exist in a logical world
- Raw data is turned into a form fit for human consumption
- Data is brought into the physical world in a *physical presentation*
- A physical referent (real-world items) TODO

Physically vs perceptually-situated visualizations:

- Physical distance separating a physical presentation and its physical referent may not necessarily match the perceived distance (e.g. visualizing microchip vs mountain)
- Spatial situatedness needs to be refined:
  - *Physically situated in space*: if its physical presentation is physically close to the data's physical referent
  - *Perceptually situated in space*: TODO

Embedded vs non-embedded visualizations:

- Embedded visualizations are deeply integrated within their physical environment
  - Different virtual sub-elements align with their related physical sub-elements

Interaction:

- By altering its pipeline (e.g. filtering data)
- By altering the physical presentation (e.g. moving around, re-arranging elements)
- Using insights to take immediate action
