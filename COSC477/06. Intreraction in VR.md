# 06. Interaction in VR

Rob Lindeman, Director of HITLab NZ.

User interaction:

- How can we do things in VR environments?
- What controllers/inputs do they support?
- As a user, what *kinds* of thins would I even *want* to do?
  - Is the task fatiguing? Will it make me feel sick

The state of VR:

- 1980s/1990s:
  - Much hype
  - No inroads into everyday life:
    - Lagging technology
      - But the technology we have today seems close
    - Lack of understanding of usability issues
    - Lack of 'killer apps' (games?)
  - Some use in specific scenarios:
    - Surgical simulation
    - Military training
    - Phobia therapy
    - Oil/gas visualization
    - Automotive design
- 2000:
  - Growth of video games led to:
    - Immense increase in hardware power
    - Reduction in hardware costs
    - Immense growth in number of users/gamers
    - Many 'new' interface devices
  - Better understanding of 3D-UI
  - Gaming emerged as the killer app (?) (at least for now)
- 2010s:
  - Lots of new hardware:
    - WiiMote, WiiMotion Plus
    - Kinect
    - Powerful smartphones (economies of scale)
    - ~12 VR/AR headsets announced
    - Lots of controllers
  - 2015:
    - A lot of VR headsets
    - Very few AR headsets
    - Many phone-integrated headsets (e.g. Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR)
    - Some locomotion controllers (e.g. treadmills), but no consumer hardware
    - A lot of companies go out of business: no use case for the products

Motivation for studying VR interaction:

- Mouse + Keyboard great for general desktop UI tasks:
  - Text entry, selection, drag/drop, scrolling, rubber banding etc.
  - Fixed computing environment
  - 2D windows, 2D mouse
- But how do we design effective techniques for 3D?
  - With a 2D device?
  - With multiple *n*-D devices?
  - New devices?
  - 2D interface widgets?
  - With a new language; new interaction techniques that can support the new environment
- Gaming:
  - Tight coupling between *action* and *reaction*
  - Requires precision
- VR gives *real* first-person experiences, not just views
  - HMDs:
    - Look behind by turning your head
  - Selecting/manipulating objects:
    - Reach out with your hand and grab it
  - Travel:
    - Walk
    - Except that you are still in a confined physical space with objects
      and cats in the way
  - Doing things that have no physical analog is more problematic
    - How do you change font size?

Existing input methods:

- Joystick, trackballs, trackpoints, trackpads, tablets, gaming controllers
- General vs purpose-built controllers:
  - General purpose:
    - Single device used for many thing
    - Mouse, joystick, gamepad, game controllers, Vive/Touch controllers, WiiMote etc.
    - Okay for many tasks, but not optimal
  - Special purpose:
    - Typically used for a specific task (e.g. driving, playing guitar)
    - Very effective for a given task
- Current devices:
  - PlayStation
    - Vibration motors with different weights in each wing to allow varying vibration
    - PS5: shoulder/trigger buttons have motors TODO
  - Xbox controllers
  - WiiMote
  - Leap Motion hand tracking
  - Kinect body tracking
  - Hand-held devices:
    - Smartphones
    - Tablets
    - Nintendo DS
    - Sony PSP

## Classification Schemes

Relative vs absolute movement:

- Mice return a delta: relative motion
- Touch screens, pen tablets return absolute position

Integrated vs separable degrees of freedom:

- e.g. Etch-a-sketch has separate X and Y controls
- Motions that are easy with one are hard with the other


Digital vs analog:

Isometric vs isotonic:

- Isometric: infinite resistance (no motion), but force sensing
  - e.g. ThinkPad TrackPoint
- Isotonic: zero resistance
- In reality, devices exist on a continuum of elasticity
  - Mice are mostly isotonic, but they do have mass and hence inertia
  - Some controls (e.g. joysticks) are self-centering

Rate control vs position control:

- TODO
Special-purpose vs general-purpose:

- Game controllers must support many types of games
  - Few 'standard' mappings: each game can do things differently (for the most part)
- Some special-purpose devices:
  - Mostly based on things that already exist in the real world
  - Examples:
    - Guitar controllers
    - Steering wheels
    - RPG keyboard/joystick
    - Drum kits, dance pads, bongos etc.

Direct vs indirect:

- Direct:
  - Click and drag with mouse/stylus/finger
  - Touch screen gestures: swipe, two-finger rotate
  - Problems:
    - Works well for things that have a physical analogue, but not for those without
    - May have low precision
    - Selection/de-selection may be messy
- Indirect
  - Use some widget to indirectly change something

3D Input Devices:

- SpaceBall/SpaceMouse
  - Isometric device which senses force
- CyberGlove II
  - From the 1990s
  - Strain sensors used to sense hand movement
- PHANTOM Omni Haptic Device
  - Stylus attached to robot arm
  - Force feedback allows user to feel surface
  - Limited working volume, only one point of contact, very limited use case
- HMD with 3/6-DOF trackers (e.g. Oculus Quest)

3D Spatial Input Devices:

- Microsoft Kinect
- Leap Motion
- Oculus Touch
- HTC Vive
  - Used touch surfaces which could be displayed by a little, rather than a joystick
    - Very different experience
- Valve Index
  - Strapped to your hand: don't need to actively hold the controller
  - Had finger tracking

Motion-Capture/Tracking Systems:

- Probably won't be that common in the future: people will just use inside-out tracking built into headsets
- Used in movies/TV and games
  - Capture actual motion and re-use
- Can be done interactively or offline
- Can capture three or more DoF
  - Positions orientation, limbs
- No good general purpose approaches to high-fidelity, full-body tracking without markers
- Attempts:
  - Magnetic tracking
    - Transmitter creates a magnetic field
    - Wired receivers stuck to clothes
    - Receivers tracked (relative to the transmitter) using changes in magnetic field
    - Pros:
      - Fairly lightweight
      - Six DoF
    - Cons:
      - Very noise near ferrous metal (e.g. rebar)
      - Limited range
  - Ultrasonic tracking
    - Speakers emitting ultrasonic sound, captured by receivers containing microphones
    - Used to compute distance
    - Receivers had to point in the right direction (hemisphere)
    - TODO
  - Inertial trackers
    - Accelerometers, gyroscopes
    - Pros:
      - Lightweight
      - Wireless
    - Cons:
      - Error accumulates
      - Only moderate accuracy
    - e.g. Wii MotionPlus
  - Optical tracking
    - Multiple fixed makers
    - Known camera parameters
    - Inside-out tracking: camera attached to user, lab-mounted fixed landmarks
    - Outside-in tracking: cameras attached to lab, landmarks attached to user
    - Active vs passive:
      - Active: markers illuminated, either through a light and reflective markers
        or by using lights as markers
      - TODO
    - PlayStation MOVE:
      - Stick with illuminated ball of known size and color
      - Camera tracker + internal tracker used for tracking
    - Leap Motion:
      - Three IR LEDs for illumination
      - Stereo cameras used for depth
        - TODO
        - Greyscale images used to illuminate hands
  - Hybrid tracking
    - Compensate negative characteristics of one approach with another

Other Input Devices:

- Speech input
- Gestures (e.g. pointing at an object)
- Device actions (e.g. buttons, joysticks)
- Head/gaze, eye blinks
  - 'Put that, there': hybrid speech + gesture

Special Purpose Input Devices:

- Some applications are more 'real' with a device that matches the real action
- Examples:
  - Light gun
  - Flight simulator motion platform
  - Snowboard/surfboard
  - Pod racer
  - Motorcycle
- Sensors are very cheap today: you may be able to simply attach some sensors to a passive object

## TODO

Mapping Devices to Actions:

- For each (user, task, environment)
  - For the four basic VR tasks
    - For each device DOF
      - Choose a mapping to an action

VR interaction:

- Must take advantage of people's real-world experience
- And for those without real-world analogues, allow users to express their intent
- Without making people tired
- Without making people sick
- While making it easy to learn and use

Main interaction tasks (Bowman et al.):

- Object selection/manipulation:
  - How does the user select the object they wish to manipulate?
  - How do they actually manipulate it?
- Navigation:
  - Wayfinding (mental): where am I now, and how do I get to where I am going?
  - Locomotion (motor): how do I travel there?
- System control:
  - Changing system parameters
- Symbolic input:
  - Text/number input
- Avatar control (Lindeman):
  - How do you control you?
- And throwing things ðŸ˜†

Objects:

- Issues:
  - Selecting single objects
  - Distance
  - Seelcting multiple objects: TODO
- Selection approaches:
  - TODO
- Manipulation approaches:
  - World in miniature (WIM): miniature world representing the world you are in
    - Can you pick yourself up?

Object selection in the real world:

- Touching/grabbing
- Pointing
  - TODo
- Voice: ask someone

Selection-task decomposition:

- *Indicate*:
  - Denote which open we intend to select
  - On desktop: move mouse
  - In VR:
    - Avatar hand-movement
    - Device movement
    - Virtual 'beam' TODO raytracing
- Confirm:
  - On desktop: mouse click
  - In VR:
    - TODO
    - Dwell (timeout)
    - Verbal cue

Reaching objects:

- Indicating at a distance
  - Go-go: larger than 1:1 mapping when arm more than a certain distance away
  - Two-handed pointing
    - TODO
- Image plain technique: TODO

Manipulation:

- Typical tasks:
  - Repositioning
  - Rotation
  - Property modification
- Approaches
  - WIM
  - 3D widgets:
    - Virtual sphere for rotation
    - Jack for scaling
  - Non-isomorphic translation/rotation
  - Skewers
  - 2D widgets

Design Guidelines:

- Use existing techniques unless you really need to
- TODO
- Match the interaction technique with the device
  - Does the task need high precision?
- Use techniques that can help reduce clutching
  - When dragging with mice: if you reach the end of the mouse pad, you need to
    grip and pick up the mouse, then move it to the opposite end of the mouse pad
    
  - 
- Non-isomorphic TODO
- TODo
- Use grasp-sensitive object selection
- Constrain degrees of freedo when possible
  - Fewer mistakes, less annoyance
- There is no single best interaction technique: just test, test, test

TODO:

- Object Impersonation (Wang, IEEE VR 2015)
  - Open headset: tablet
  - User becomes the object:
    - e.g. moving a light: user's head becomes the light, can turn head to position beam
    - e.g. paving a road: the path you move in becomes the road
- Navigation: wayfinding
  - TODO
- Navigation: travel
  - Limited physical space, possibly infinite virtual space
  - Different travel types:
    - Walking, running, turning, strafing, back stepping, crawling, quick start/stop,
      driving, flying, tale_porting
    - Also laying down, kneeling, ducking, jumping
  - TODO
  - Travel isn't the goal
- Initial Exploration of a Multi-Sensory Design Space:
  - Spinning chair: user leans forwards/backwards to move
  - Fans opposing direction ot travel
- Finger Walking (Yan et al., 2016)
  - Short distance: finger tapping on a touchpad to 'walk'
  - Long distance: two fingers (like feet on a hoverboard), force determines speed
    and angle between fingers determines angle
- TriggerWalking (Sarupuri et al., 2016):
  - Tap controller trigger to walk: controller orientation controls moment direction
- System Control using Hybrid Virtual Environments (Wang, 3DUI 2013):
  - Open headset
  - Tablet taped to arm used for selecting objects
  - Drop items in the scene in VR
- Avatar Control
  - Paul Yost
  - IMU controllers attached to arms, feet for full body tracking


User, Task and Enveironment:

- The 'optimal' interface depends on:
- TODO
- The capability of the user:
  - Dexterity
  - Expected level of expertise
- Task
  - Task complexity
  - Granularity: how precise does the input need to be
- Environment:
  - Stationary, moving, noisy environments
