# 03. Developing Virtual Reality Experiences

Dr Tham Piumsomboon, School of Product Design.

## Current VR Development Tools

2016: rise of consumer HMDs. Oculus, HTC Vive.

XR Fragmentation: different vendors all had their own proprietary APIs (e.g. Steam VR, Hololens, Oculus, HTC Vive, Magic Leap).

Kronos group (which created OpenGL, Vulkan, etc.) developed the OpenXR standard: cross-platform API supported by many hardware vendors.

Toolkits:

- [VRTK](https://www.vrtk.io)
  - Open source, Microsoft
- [MRTK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/)
- [XRTK]()
  - Fork of MRTK developed by Unity
- [Oculus Interaction SDK]
  - May be depreciated

Game Engines:

- HITLab using Unity engine
- A few others available: Unreal, CRYENGINE, GameMaker Studio, Amazon Lumberyard
- Social platforms (e.g. Breakroom)

## Developing VR Experiences

Immersion:

- Feel like you are physically and mentally in the virtual world
- How to simulate a large world in a limited physical space?
- In non-VR games:
  - Suspension of disbelief: enough realism in the experience that you can ignore the issues

Models of immersion:

- Three types
  - Sensory immersion:
    - Disassociation with the real world
  - Challenge-based immersion:
    - Control:
      - Ask what made great games from the past (e.g. Mario) great?
      - Input mechanisms (e.g. game controllers, hand gestures)
    - Challenge:
      - Challenges must be achievable: too difficult -> frustrated; too easy -> bored
      - Hence, the difficulty must be balanced to make the experience rewarding
    - Cognitive involvement:
      - What you get out of the experience:
        - Fun
        - Social aspects
        - Learning/training
        - Work
  - Imaginative immersion:
    - Emotional involvement

Unity:

- Unity Settings -> XR Plug-in Management: use OpenXR (e.g. to support Windows MR headset)
  - Windows MR app needs to be running in the background
- Add interaction profile
- Package manager -> XR Interaction toolkit (`com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit`)
- Add XR Origin GameObject: virtual camera maps to headset position and orientation
  - Add input action component: XR default input action
  - Also adds controller game objects


Analysis -> Profiler

- Visualize frame rate of application and components (e.g. rendering, scripting, physics, display sync) that make up the processing time
- High frame rate important to prevent motion sickness
- Project Settings -> Quality to increase/reduce quality and decrease/increase frame rate

Game engines components:

- Core functionality:
  - Rendering engine
  - Physics engine
    - And collision detection
- Sound, scripting, animation, networking, streaming, memory management etc.

Game loop:

- Read HID (human input device) state
- Update scene state
  - Physics engine
  - User input
  - Multiplayer networking
  - Collisions
  - Animations
  - NPC state
  - Audio
- Render the scene

The subsystems will often update at different rates (e.g. NPC behavior may update at ~1 FPS, physics engine at 120 FPS, renderer at 60 FPS).



Camera placements and control mappings:

- Relatively easy to convert 2.5D to 3D
- FPS games: camera mapping can be done easiy by adding XR Origin
  - Controllers need to be mapped to existing controls
  - XROrigin:
    - Copy tracking origin, put it in player
    - Put controllers under player
    - Controllers: Add default SOMETHING
    - PlayeR: add locomotion, input system = 
      - XR origin set
      - Add reference to XRI default input actions
    - Player: add continuous move provider, left hand XRI LeftHand LocomotionMove
    - Player: add snap turn provider, left hand XRI SnapMove
- XR Grab Intractable: add to a game object to allow a user to grab it from afar
- XR Socket Interactor: allows interactables to be 'docked' to the game object
  - Box collider: disable `Is trigger` TODO
- Scripts: `using UnityEngine.InputSystem`, create `InputActionReference` property (or private property with `[SerializeField]` annotation)


ProBuilder package: allows you to create new primitive shapes.


## VR Interaction Design

Even if the graphics are good, you need to be able to inteact wit hthe environemnt.

Seven principles of fudnamental design (Norman):

- Discoverable: users can discover what actions are possible
- Feedback: full and continous feedback about the results of your actions and the current state of the world
- Conceptual model: design informs the user of the system's conceptual model, making it seem intuitive
- Affordances: TODO
  - the perceived affrodance should match the actual affordance
  - Clues as to how something works:
- Signifiers: something to indicate TODO
- Mappings: relationship between the controls and actions is understood
- Constraints: TODO

VR: mappings are from games, not reality (e.g. using scissors: clicK a button to use, not picking it up with your fingers). Chairs: cannot sit on VR chairs in real life


VR affordances:

- Use visual cues to show possible affordances
- Perceived afordances hsould match actual affordances
- Good cognitive model: map object behavior to expected behavior
  - May vary by culture
- Controllers ahve different controls:
  - Some have joysticks, some have touchpads, some have buttons
  - Trigger buttons
- Examples:
  - Buttons that can be pushed
  - Objects that can be picked up
  - Doors tha can be opened and alked through
  - [Mutual human actuation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKGdQjx-_BI)


User groups:

 Age:
Children require different interface designs
Older people have difernt needs
Prior experiences with HMDs
TODO

WHole user needs:

- Social: don't make them look stupid
- Cultural: follow localcultural norms
- Physical: can they use the interface
- TODO

Guidelines:

- TODO



Summary:

- High-fidelity graphics in VR is possible if we can afford it computationally
  - But not sufficient for immersion
- SCI immersive model: engage user through sensory, challenge-based, and imaginative immersion
- General design principles can be applied to VR design
- Penty of opportunites of richer VR interaction beyond what general design principles could govern
