# 10. Human Perception and Presence in MR

Rob Lindeman, Director HITLab NZ.

In popular media:
- UI about complementing the character: their personality, proficiency in technology, basic scene state (e.g. red blaring lights for bad information coming).
- Impressions matter
- Flow is a good concept to study
- Popular media can give us good ideas

Terms:

- Presence: sense of 'being there'
- Immersion: being surrounded
- Flow: heightened state of awareness/action
- Situation awareness: clear understanding of surroundings
- Natural interaction: interaction that recedes into the background
  - Low cognitive load

## 'Being there'

What does it mean to 'be here'?

- Experience of going through some process to get to a place (e.g. walking through the door)

What does it mean to be together?

- Eye contact with others, talking, shaking hands

How can we re-create these using technology?

In a real environment, we can use:

- Hand-held mobile device
  - Phones/tablets
- In-vehicle system
  - Navigation/traffic
- Augmented reality
  - There++: augmenting reality

For a remote physical environment:

- Phone
- Video conference
  - Eye contact difficult: looking at the camera (for eye contact) means you can't see others
- Teleoperated robots
  - Allows movement and possibly even manipulating the environment
- Drones

In virtual environments:

- Video games: FPS, MMOs
  - Can be present even without VR
  - Multiplayer games mimic physical co-presence
- Immersive learning environments
  - e.g. immersive chemistry
- Surgical simulations
  - Allows more precision and manipulators
  - Allows training on simulated data

In *described* environments:

- Movies
- Books
  - As long as you have the essence, the brain is able to fill in the blanks through their imagination
  - However, everyone imagines a different scene: this can lead to disappointment when a book is adapted into a movie

### Game Design

What makes a good game?

> A great game is a *series* of *interesting* and *meaningful* **choices** made by the player in pursuit of a *clear and compelling goal*
>
> - Sid Meier

'Natural Funativity':

- Survival-skill training
- Needs to have the player develop a set of skills with increasing levels of difficulty
- Putting them to the test: missions, quests, levels etc.
- Prize at the end (or in the middle)
  - e.g. unlocking items, badges, leaderboards

Game structure:

- Movies:
  - (typically) have a linear structure
  - Are fixed - controlled by the writer/director/cinematographer
- In comparison, games must provide 'interesting and meaningful choices'
  - User must be in control
  - Not fun to die due to circumstances outside your control
- Choices must make sense in the context of the story

### Flow

Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, *Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience* (1990):

- Hightened sense of perception
- Highly focused on the primary task
- **In the 'sweet spot' between frustration and boredom**
Occurs in athletes, writers, video gamers, programmers
For game design:
- The 'sweet spot' for difficulty is relatively large
- Game difficulty must match the player skill (and increase over time)
  - But if it matches exactly, this itself will cause the player to get boredom.
    Hence, difficulty should oscillate slightly

Convexity of game play:

- Provide a choke point: all paths, regardless of what the player chose, should lead to a single result
  - e.g. bosses at the end of game stages, story progression
  - The number of choices available after every iteration should increase
    - e.g. unlocked items, skills, regions to explore
- This addresses the narrative paradox: writers can create a complete story while providing players with (the perception of) choice

Flow and convexity can be combined:

- The choke point should be at the higher end of difficulty
- After the choke point, choices can be provided to the user and the difficulty slightly decreased (relative to the player's skill)

- By Jenova Chen (Thatgamecompany)
- Adaptive difficulty: game tries to determine player skill and adaptively change the difficulty level to match

Characterizing Flow:

- A challenge activity that requires skills
- The merging of action and awareness
  - Tight coupling between actions and responses
- Clear goals
- Direct feedback
- Concentration on the task at hand
- Sense of control
- Loss of self-consciousness
- Transformation of time

### Immersion

Immersion:

- To completely surround/envelope it
  - e.g. swimming, intensive language course
- Affects **all** the senses
  - Sound can be as important as the visuals
  - Also need to consider touch and smell
- How can we immerse MR users?

Haptic ChairIO (Feng et al., 2016):

- Chair that looks like a joystick
- And acts like a joystick: it leans, and tilt sensors can be used as input
- HITLab added vibration floor, pan-tilt fan units:
  - Combined with VR headset for audio/video
  - Footstep vibrations and fans (wind from the 'motion') provide movement cues
  - Non-fatiguing: sitting down, hands free to do other work
  - Clear mapping of seat movement to camera movement

Natural interaction:

- Recedes into the background:
  - Low cognitive load for interaction techniques
  - Stimuli/feedback can be easily digested
  - Low cumber
- Multi-sensory feedback
- Multi-modal user input
  - e.g. 'put that over there': combines pointing (gesture) and voice
- Hybrid ways of executing commands
  - Interactions should evolve with the user
  - Provide scaffolding to novices
  - Provide fast and efficient interactions for experts

Personal experiences:

- We all filter our senses
- Variations in eyesight, hearing etc.
- Different childhood experiences
- Different moods

### Presence

Types of presence:

- Presence: sense of 'being there'
  - How virtual characters react to you
  - The depth of the interactions with the environment
    - Can you turn on the tap? Open a cupboard? Pick up a cat?
    - Every interaction has a cost, both in terms of development and performance
  - The invisibility/naturalness of the interface
  - The lack of distractions (e.g. cables)
- Co-presence: 'being there together'
  - Multiple people can be in the same shared space without feeling 'together'
- Tele-presence: 'being over there'
  - Remotely present in a partially physical space
- Tele-co-presence: 'being over there together'?

Measuring presence:

- How can be measure if someone feels 'present' in a game or other virtual environment?
- How can we measure the depth of presence?
- Methods:
  - Questionnaires
    - Slater Usoh Steed
    - Witmer & Singer
    - Questions must be written carefully and validated
      - Ensure they are unambiguous
    - Measurement is done after the fact
  - Behaviors
    - Watch the user and see how they react
      - If you throw something at them, do they duck?
      - If they get hit, do they scream?
      - Will they refuse to walk off a ledge?
    - Hard to measure the *depth* of presence (but easy to see it)
    - Issue: you may need to invent/incorporate events
  - Physiological measures
    - Possible metrics:
      - Heart rate
      - Sweat (galvanic skin response or skin conductance)
      - Breathing rate/regularity
    - Hard to fake
    - Issues:
      - Some measures take time to settle
      - May need to calibrate to a baseline
      - Need to wear sensors

## The Real World

The real world is great:

- Fast update rate
- Multi-modal rendering
- Really good physics
- Nearly infinite fidelity
- Can handle massive numbers of objects and players
  - Realistic crowd behavior
- Minimal lag

Hence, it is useful to use existing things from the real world: this makes AR easier than VR in terms of fidelity.


But **beyond perceptual**, there is:

- Anticipation
- Expectations
- Previous experiences

We can tap into experiences already anchored in the mind of the user: provide the essence and let the brain fill in the details, or plant new experiences: seeds that can grow and become scaffolding for future experiences.

To do this:

- *Prime* the user to *expect* what you are about to show
  - A VR experience starts long before the physical experience:
    - Advertising
    - Word of mouth
    - To plant the seed, tell give them some specific information: this reduces *variability* between users.
      - e.g. while you wait in line at a Disney park, you are shown videos, newspaper clips describing the backstory etc. which immerse you and reduce perceived wait time
- Remove all distractions
  - Non-interactable objects (e.g. cupboards that you can't open)
  - Lack of interaction precision
  - Fatigue
  - Bumping into cables
  - Wearing a lot of gear

The myth of technical immersion:

- Technology is not necessary to achieve immersion
  - Books are very low-tech but can still transport us to fantastic places
- Our 'high-fidelity' technology is still relatively low-fidelity:
  - Leverage the mind to fill in the blank
  - e.g. in *Alien*, you don't see the alien until the end
  - e.g. reading a ghost story at night with a window open: the environment and story are matched
- Tasks should be:
  - Easy to learn
  - Easy to carry out
  - Not fatiguing
  - Require appropriate precision
    - e.g. movement/velocity control: need both very fine and large movements
  - Support appropriate expressiveness

Impossible spaces:

- Have a non one-to-one mapping for rotation to redirect walking and effectively increase the size of the virtual space
- Change blindness for redirected walking: modify/reconfigure the virtual space when they are looking the other way
  - Redirection also works with reaching, touching
