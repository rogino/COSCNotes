# 4. Data Normalization

Looking at an existing database and attempting to improve the design.

## Information Design Guidelines

User view (logical):

- Is the database design clear
- Can users understand the whole schema

Storage/base relation level:

- How are tuples stored
- Is too much memory being used

### Semantics of Attributes

Guideline 1: each tuple should represent one entity or relationship instance:

- Don't mix attributes from different entities
- Only use foreign keys to refer to other entities
- Separate entity and relationship attributes

Guideline 2: design relations so that no update anomalies are present:

- If any anomalies are present, document them and ensure programs deal with them correctly

Guideline 3: design relations to have as few NULL values as possible:

- If an attribute is NULL frequently, place it in a separate relation

Guideline 4: relations should be designed to satisfy the **lossless join condition**:

- No spurious tuples should be generated from doing a natural join (i.e. all tuples are meaningful)

## Decomposition

Dividing a relation into two or more relations. To do this, normalization is required - this is essentially a set of tests used to determine the 'quality' of a schema.

## Functional Dependencies

Assume the universal relation schema is $R(A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n)$.

A set of attributes, $X$, **functionally determines** a set of attributes $Y$ if the value of $X$ determines a unique value for $Y$. $X \rightarrow Y$.

**For each value of $X$, there is exactly one value of $Y$**. The simplest example of this is if $X$ is the primary key and $Y$ is the tuple.

If two tuples have the same value for $X$, they have the same value for $Y$; if $tuple\_1[X] = tuple\_2[X]$, then $tuple\_1[Y] = tuple\_2[Y]$.

### Inference Rules

Given a set of FDs $F$, we can infer additional FDs that hold whenever the FDs in $F$ hold.

The **closure** of a set $F$ is the set $F+$ which contains all FDs that can be inferred from $F$.

If $X \rightarrow Y$ is inferred from $F$, then it is notated as $F \models X \rightarrow Y$.

Armstrong's inference rules state that:

- IR1, Reflexive: if $Y \subset X$, $X \rightarrow Y$
- IR2, Augmentation: if $X \rightarrow Y$, then $XZ \rightarrow YZ$ (adding same set of attributes to both sides)
- IR3, Transitive: if $X \rightarrow Y$ and $Y \rightarrow Z$, then $X \rightarrow Z$

These three rules form a sound and complete set of inference (all functional dependencies can be inferred from these rules, and all are correct).

Using these three rules, we can form deduce three more rules:

- IR4, Decomposition: if $X \rightarrow YZ$, then $X \rightarrow Y$ and $X \rightarrow Z$
  - By reflexivity, $YZ \rightarrow Y$
  - By the transitive rule, $X \rightarrow YZ \rightarrow Y$
  - Repeat for $Z$
- IR5, Union: if $X \rightarrow Y$ and $X \rightarrow Z$, $X \rightarrow YZ$
  - By augmentation to $X \rightarrow Z$, $XY \rightarrow YZ$
  - By augmentation to $X \rightarrow Y$, $XX \rightarrow XY$ so $X \rightarrow XY$
  - By the transitive rule, $X \rightarrow YZ$
- IR6, Pseudo-transitivity: if $X \rightarrow Y$ and $WY \rightarrow Z$, then $WX \rightarrow Z$
  - By augmentation to $X \rightarrow Y$, $WX \rightarrow WY$
  - By the transitive rule, $WX \rightarrow Z$

#### Example

Given $R(A, B, C, D)$ and a set of functional dependencies $F = \{ A \rightarrow B, AC \rightarrow D, BC \rightarrow D, CD \rightarrow A \}$, show $AC \rightarrow D$ is redundant.

Using Armstrong's theorems:

- By augmentation on $A \rightarrow B$, $AC \rightarrow BC$
- By the transitive rule on $AC \rightarrow BC$ and $BC \rightarrow D$, $AC \rightarrow D$

Using the definition of equivalent sets of functional dependencies (see equivalence sets section):

$$
G = \{ A \rightarrow B, BC \rightarrow D, CD \rightarrow A \}
$$

$F$ definitely covers $G$, so only need to find out if $G$ covers $F$.

For all FDs in $F$:

- $A \rightarrow B$ definitely covered since $G$ contains $A \rightarrow B$
- ...
- $AC \rightarrow D$: $\{AC\}_G^+ = \{ A, C \}$
  - After one iteration: $\{ A, C, B, D \}$. All attributes are now in the set
  - $D$ is in $\{AC\}_G^+$ and all others are covered, so $G$ covers $F$. Hence, $G$ and $F$ are equivalent so $AC \rightarrow D$ is redundant

#### Determining the closure

Closure of a set of attributes $X$ with respect to $F$ is the set $X+$ of all attributes that are functionally determined by $X$.

$\{X\}_F^+$ can be calculated by repeated applying the three primary rules:

```python
X_plus = X
while changes_occur()
  for Y, Z in F: # F is a set of functional dependencies of the form Y -> Z
    if Y in X_plus:
      X_plus.append(Z)
```

##### Example

Given $R(A, B, C, D, E)$ as a set of functional dependencies $F = \{ A \rightarrow BC, CD \rightarrow E, AC \rightarrow E, B \rightarrow D, E \rightarrow AB \}$, determine all candidate keys in $R$:

Start with single attributes:

$$
\{A\}_F^+ = { A }
$$

Look at the functional dependencies:

- $A \rightarrow BC$ and $A$ is in $\{A\}_F^+$, so $B$ and $C$ can both be added to the set
- $CD \rightarrow E$ but $D$ is not in $\{A\}_F^+$, so skip it
- $AC \rightarrow E$ and both $A$ and $E$ are in $\{A\}_F^+$, so add $E$
- $B \rightarrow D$ and $B$ is in $\{A\}_F^+$, so add $D$
- We now have all attributes so we do not need to continue

As $\{A\}_F^+$ contains all the attributes, $A$ is a candidate key.

For $B$:

- Loop through the FDs once: $\{B\}_F^+ = \{ B, D \}$
- An attribute was added so repeat
- No changes, so $B$ only determines $D$ and hence, it is not a candidate key

$\{C\}_F^+ = \{ C \}$: only determines itself. The same is true for $D$.

After one iteration, $\{E\}_F^+ = \{ A, B, E \}$. After another iteration, $C$ and $D$ get added. Thus, $E$ is also a primary key.

Now, look at tuples with two attributes. Ignore tuples containing $A$ or $E$ as they are candidate keys by themselves:

- $\{BC\}_F^+ = \{ B, C, D, E, A \}$
- $\{BD\}_F^+ = \{ B, D \}$
- $\{CD\}_F^+ = \{ C, D, E, A, B \}$

Thus, $A$, $E$, $BC$ and $CD$ are candidate keys. No three-tuples can be created so the search stops here.

### Equivalence of Sets of FDs

Two sets of FDs, $F$ and $G$ are equivalent if $F^+ = G^+$: every FD in $F$ can be inferred from $G$ and vice-versa.

Alternatively, $F$ **covers** $G$ if $G^+ \subseteq F^+$. Hence, $F$ and $G$ are equivalent if $F$ covers $G$ and vice-versa. This is much easier to test:

Calculate $\{X\}_F^+$ ($X^+$ with respect to $F$) for each FD $X \rightarrow Y$ in **$G$**; if this includes all attributes in $Y$, the sets are equal.

#### Example

Check if $F$ and $G$ are equivalent:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F &= \{ A \rightarrow C, AC \rightarrow D, E \rightarrow AD, E \rightarrow H \} \\
G &= \{ A \rightarrow CD, E \rightarrow AH \}
\end{aligned}
$$

FDs in $G$:

- $A \rightarrow CD$: $\{A\}_F^+ = \{ A, C, D \}$. $C$ and $D$ are both in the set
- $E \rightarrow AH$: $\{E\}_F^+ = \{ E, A, D, H, C \}$. $A$ and $H$ are both in the set

Hence, $F$ covers $G$.

FDs in $F$:

- $A \rightarrow C$: $\{A\}_F^+ = \{ A, C, D \}$. $C$ is in the set
- $AC \rightarrow D$: $\{AC\}_F^+ = \{ A, C, D \}$. $D$ is in the set
- $E \rightarrow AH$: $\{E\}_F^+ = \{ E, A, D, H, C \}$. $A$ and $H$ are both in the set
- $E \rightarrow H$: $\{E\}_F^+ = \{ E, A, D, H, C \}$. $H$ is in the set

Hence, $G$ covers $F$.

Hence, the sets are equivalent.

### Minimal Sets of FDs

A set of FDs $F$ is minimal if:

- Every dependency in $F$ has a single attribute on its RHS
- Removing any dependency will lead to a set that is not equivalent to $F$
- Replacing any dependency $X \rightarrow A$ with $Y \rightarrow A$, where $Y \subset X$, will lead to a set that is not equivalent to $F$

Every set of FDs has an equivalent minimal set (or sets - there can be several equivalent minimal sets).

#### Example

Is $G$ minimal? If not, find the minimal set:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& G = \{ \\
& \quad \text{SSN} \rightarrow \{\text{Name}, \text{Born}, \text{Address}, \text{DepartmentId} \}, \\
& \quad \text{DepartmentId } \rightarrow \{ \text{Name}, \text{ManagerSSN} \} \\
& \}
\end{aligned}
$$

First condition violated; RHS has multiple attributes for both dependencies.

Using the decomposition rule ($A \rightarrow BC$ means $A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow C$):

- $\text{SSN} \rightarrow \text{Name}$
- $\text{SSN} \rightarrow \text{Born}$
- $\text{SSN} \rightarrow \text{Address}$
- $\text{SSN} \rightarrow \text{DepartmentId}$
- $\text{DepartmentId} \rightarrow \text{Name}$
- $\text{DepartmentId} \rightarrow \text{ManagerSSN}$

The third rule is met as the LHS only has one element, so it cannot be reduced further.

The second rule is met; it is obvious that all dependencies are necessary.

## Normal Forms Based on Primary Keys

Normalization is the process of decomposing 'bad' relations into smaller relations.

### Keys

**Superkey** of relation $R$: set of attributes $S$, $S \subseteq R$ such that no two legal tuples in $R$ will have the same $S$ values.

**Key** $K$: superkey where removal of any attribute will cause it to not be a tuple.

If a relation has more than one key, each is called a **candidate key**, with one arbitrarily designated as the **primary key** and the others as **secondary keys**.

A **prime attribute** is a member of at least one candidate key.

### First Normal Form

**Every attribute is single and atomic**; no composite or multivalued attributes or nested relations.

### Second Normal Form

**Full functional dependency**: FD of the form $Y \rightarrow Z$ where removing *any* attribute from $Y$ means the FD no longer holds. It is called a **partial** dependency if this does not hold.

Second normal form adds more conditions to the first normal form: **no non-prime attribute is partially functionally dependent on the primary key**.

To transform into second normal form, split into smaller tables: if the primary key is $A$ and $B$, and attribute $C$ is fully dependent on both $A$ and $B$ but $D$ is dependent on only $B$, create two tables, $\{ A, B, C\}$ and $\{B, D\}$. The primary key of the secondary table is only $B$, so $D$ is fully dependent on the primary key.

### Third Normal Form

If $X \rightarrow Y$ and $Y \rightarrow Z$, $X \rightarrow Z$ is a **transitive functional dependency**.

Relations in third normal form are in 2NF and no non-prime attributes are transitively dependent on the primary key i.e. $\text{PrimaryKey} \rightarrow \text{NonPrimeAttribute}$.

Example: $\text{SSN}$ identifies $\text{DepartmentID}$ and $\text{DepartmentID}$ identifies $\text{DepartmentName}$. Hence $\text{DepartmentName}$ must be in a separate relation from $\text{SSN}$, with $\text{DNumber}$ acting as the primary key.

## General Normal Form Definitions

These take into account candidate keys, not just the primary key.

Second normal form: no non-prime attribute is partially functionally dependent on any key of the relation.

Third normal form: for all FDs:

- The **LHS is a superkey** of $R$ OR
- The **RHS is a prime attribute** of $R$

Only the first condition applies for BCNF.

**Ensure at least one table contains the entire primary key, and check that it is a minimal cover before transforming**.

### Example

$R(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J)$ and $F = \{ AB \rightarrow C, A \rightarrow DE, B \rightarrow F, F \rightarrow GH, D \rightarrow IJ \}$.

#### Find the key of the table

Tip: look for any attribute that never appears on the RHS of any dependency.

$\{B\}_F^+ = \{ B \}$; first loop: $\{ B, F \}$; second loop: $\{ B, F, G, H \}$. This does not contain all attributes, so $B$ by itself is not a key

Try $A$ and $B$: $\{AB\}_F^+$ = $\{ A, B \}$; ...; this contains all attributes, so it is the key.

#### Decompose $R$ into 2NF

All non-prime attributes are fully dependent on $AB$. Hence, there can be no dependencies of the form $A \rightarrow X$ or $B \rightarrow X$. Hence, $A \rightarrow DE$ and $B \rightarrow F$ violate this rule. Split the relation into multiple relations:

- $R_1(A, D, E, I, J)$
  - Start with $(A, D, E)$, and as $D \rightarrow IJ$, $I$ and $J$ need to be added
- $R_2(B, F, G, H)$
  - Start with $(B, F)$, and then add $G$ and $H$ as they are dependent on $F$
- $R_3(A, B, C)$

#### Decompose $R$ into 3NF

$A \rightarrow D$ and $D \rightarrow IJ$, so there are transitive dependencies:

- $R_{11}(A, D, E)$
- $R_{12}(D, I, J)$

$B \rightarrow F$ and $F \rightarrow GH$, so decompose:

- $R_{21}(B, F)$
- $R_{22}(F, G, H)$

$R_3$ has no transitive dependencies.

## Boyce-Codd Normal Form

An even stricter form of 3NF: if $X \rightarrow A$, then $X$ is a superkey of $R$.

It is not always desirable to transform a relation into BCNF as some FDs may be lost in the process.

In addition, it may not be possible to transform into BCNF.

### Example

- $\text{ID} \rightarrow \text{CountryName}, \text{LotNumber}, \text{Area}$
- $\text{CountyName}, \text{LotNumber} \rightarrow \text{ID}, \text{Area}$
- $\text{Area} \rightarrow \text{CountyName}$

$\text{Area}$ is a non-prime dependency so it violates BCNF.

Decompose $\text{Area}$, $\text{CountyName}$ into their own table, with $\text{Area}$ being the primary key, and another table with $\text{PropertyId}, \text{Area}, \text{LotNumber}$, with $\text{PropertyID}$ being the primary key.

Note that the dependencies that $\text{PropertyID} \rightarrow \text{CountyName}$ and $\text{CountyName}, \text{LotNumber} \rightarrow \text{ID}$ have been lost. Hence, converting to BCNF can sometimes be unreliable.

### Example

Determine which normal form the relation, $R(A, B, C, D)$, is in. $AB$ is the primary key.
The functional dependencies are $F = \{ AB \rightarrow CD, C \rightarrow ABD, D \rightarrow C \}$ If necessary, decompose into BCNF.

$C$ and $D$ are also candidate keys.

- 1NF: all attributes single and atomic
- 2NF: all attributes are prime attributes, so there are no partial dependencies
- 3NF: either a superkey on LHS or prime attribute on RHS; all attributes are prime so 3NF
- BCNF: superkey on LHS; $AB$, $C$ and $D$ are all superkeys

### Example

$T$ lists dentist/patient data; patient given appointment at specific date and time with a dentist in a particular room; the dentist is in the same room for all appointments on a given day. Find examples of insertion/deletion/update anomalies, and describe the process of normalizing it to BCNF.

$T(\text{DNo}, \text{DName}, \text{PNo}, \text{PName}, \text{ADate}, \text{ATime}, \text{Room})$. The primary key is $\text{DNo}, \text{PNo}, \text{ADate}$.

Informal guideline: do not mix attributes from different entity types; the table has information on dentists, patients and appointments.

Insertion/deletion/update anomalies:

- Insertion: can have two tuples with the same dentist number but different name (and same for patients)
- Insertion: patient that has registered but has no appointment. There will be no $\text{DNo}$ or $\text{ADate}$, so cannot insert it into the table (same for dentists)
- Deletion: deleting an appointment could remove all information about the patient if it was their only appointment
- Insertion: different rooms for the same dentist on the same day

Functional dependencies:

- $\{ \text{DNo}, \text{PNo}, \text{ADate} \} \rightarrow \{ \text{DName}, \text{PName}, \text{ATime}, \text{Room} \}$ (decompose this into four FDs)
- $\text{DNo} \rightarrow \text{DName}$
- $\text{PNo} \rightarrow \text{PName}$
- $\{ \text{DNo}, \text{ADate} \} \rightarrow \text{Room}$

1NF: all attributes are simple and atomic.

2NF: Non-prime attributes that fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

- Non-prime attributes: $\text{Room}$, $\text{DName}$, $\text{PName}$, $\text{ATime}$
- The second, third and forth dependencies violate this as $\text{DNo}$ and $\text{PNo}$ are part of but not the whole primary key

Decompose the table to meet 2NF:

- From FD2: $\text{DNo}, \text{DName}$; $\text{DNo}$ is key
  - $\text{DNo} \rightarrow \text{DName}$
- From FD3: $\text{PNo}, \text{PName}$; $\text{PNo}$ is key
  - $\text{PNo} \rightarrow \text{PName}$
- From FD4: $\text{DNo}, \text{ADate}, \text{Room}$; $\text{DNo}$, $\text{ADate}$ are the keys
  - $\{ \text{DNo}, \text{ADate} \} \rightarrow \text{Room}$
- From remaining attributes: $\text{DNo}, \text{PNo}, \text{ADate}, \text{Time}$; $\text{DNo}$, $\text{PNo}$ and $\text{ADate}$ are keys
  - $\{ \text{DNo}, \text{PNo}, \text{ADate} \} \rightarrow \text{ATime}$

Each table now represents information about a single entity.

3NF: LHS superkey or RHS prime attribute. BCNF: LHS superkey.
For all tables, the LHS is the primary key so it it is in both 3NF and BCNF form.

## Relational Synthesis

The **universal relation**, *R*, contains all attributes you wish to store. Decompose this into $n$ tables $R_i$ with the following properties:

- Attribute preservation: $\cup_{i}{R_i} = R$
- Dependency preservation: each FD either appears in one of the decomposed relations or can be inferred
- Lossless join: when tables are joined, there are no spurious tuples

### Algorithm

- Find a minimal cover *G* for *F* (minimize number of FDs)
- For each LHS $X$ of a FD in *G*, create a relation $X \cup A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_m$ where $X \rightarrow A$ (i.e. table for each FD and their dependents)
- Place any remaining (unplaced) attributes in a single relation schema to ensure attributes are preserved

#### Finding a Minimal Cover

For a set of FDs to be minimal:

- There is one attribute on the RHS
- You cannot replace the LHS of any FD with a smaller set, and still have an equivalent set of FDs
- You cannot remove any FDs from a set

To find a minimal cover *G* for *F*:

- Initialize *G* to *F*
- Replace each FD $X \rightarrow A_1, \dots, A_n$ with $n$ FDs: $X \rightarrow A_1$, ..., $X \rightarrow A_n$ (decomposition rule)
- For each $X \rightarrow A$ in $G$:
  - For each attribute $B$ in $X$:
    - Let $Y=X-B$, $J=(G - (X \rightarrow A) ) \cup \{ Y \rightarrow A \}$
      - $J$ Remove an attribute from the LHS and in $G$, replace the original FD with the one with the new LHS
    - Compute $Y_{J}^+$ and $Y_{G}^+$. If they are equal, replace $X \rightarrow A$ with $Y \rightarrow A$ in $G$, and set $X=Y$
- For each $X \rightarrow A$ in $G$:
  - Compute $X_{G - (X \rightarrow A)}^+$; if it contains $A$, then the FD $X \rightarrow A$ is redundant so remove it from $G$

##### Example

Find the minimal cover for $F=\{ ABC \rightarrow D, AB \rightarrow C, C \rightarrow B \}$.

$G$ is initially the set of:

- $ABC \rightarrow D$
- $AB \rightarrow C$
- $C \rightarrow B$

$C \rightarrow B$ cannot be minimized further

Check $ABC \rightarrow D$:

- Try remove $A$: $BC \rightarrow D$
  - Compute $\{BC\}_G^+$
    - $= \{ B, C \}$
    - Can't add any more attributes
  - Compute $\{BC\}_{G'}^+$, where $G'=\{ BC \rightarrow D, AB \rightarrow C, C \rightarrow B \}$
    - $= \{ B, C \}$
    - $= \{ B, C, D \}$
  - They are different, so you cannot remove $A$
- Try remove $B$: $AC \rightarrow D$
- Compute $\{AC\}_G^+$
  - $= \{ A, C \}$
  - $= \{ A, C, B \}$
  - $= \{ A, C, B, D \}$
- Compute $\{AC\}_{G'}^+$, where $G'=\{ AC \rightarrow D, AB \rightarrow C, C \rightarrow B \}$
  - $= \{ A, C \}$
  - $= \{A, C, B \}$
  - $= \{A, C, B, D \}$
- They are the same, so $B$ can be removed

$G$ is now the set of:

- $AC \rightarrow D$
- $AB \rightarrow C$
- $C \rightarrow B$

- Try remove $C$: $A \rightarrow D$ (using the new dependency, not $ABC \rightarrow D$)
- Compute $\{A\}_G^+$
  - $= \{ A \}$
  - There is no functional dependency that can be used
- Compute $\{A\}_{G'}^+$, where $G'=\{ A \rightarrow D, AB \rightarrow C, C \rightarrow B \}$
  - $= \{ A \}$
  - $= \{A, D \}$
- They are different, so $A$ cannot be removed

Now check $AB \rightarrow C$:

- Try remove $A$: $B \rightarrow C$
  - Compute $\{B\}_G^+$:
    - $= \{ B \}$
    - $= \{ B, C \}$
  - Compute $\{B\}_{G'}^+$, where $G'=\{ AC \rightarrow D, B \rightarrow C, C \rightarrow B \}$:
    - $= \{ B \}$
  - They are different, so $A$ cannot be removed
- Try remove $B$: $A \rightarrow C$
  - Compute $\{A\}_G^+$
    - $= \{ A \}$
    - $= \{ A, C \}$
    - $= \{ A, C, B \}$
    - $= \{ A, C, B, D \}$
  - Compute $\{A\}_{G'}^+$, where $G'=\{ AC \rightarrow D, A \rightarrow C, C \rightarrow B \}$:
    - $= \{ A \}$
    - $= \{ A, C \}$
    - $= \{ A, C, B \}$
- They are different, so $B$ cannot be removed

Now, check if all three FDs are necessary:

- $AC \rightarrow D$:
  - $\{AC\}_{G - \{AC \rightarrow D\}}^+ = \{ A, C, B \}$; $D$ is not in the FD so it cannot be removed
- $AB \rightarrow C$:
  - $\{AB\}_{G - \{AB \rightarrow C\}}^+ = \{ A, B \}$; $C$ is not in the FD so it cannot be removed
- $C \rightarrow B$:
  - $\{C\}_{G - \{C \rightarrow B\}}^+ = \{ C \}$; $B$ is not in the FD so it cannot be removed

Hence, the minimal cover is - $G = \{ AC \rightarrow D, AB \rightarrow C, C \rightarrow B \}$:

- Create a table $A, C, D$ with $A$ and $C$ as keys
- Create a table $A, B, C$ with $A$ and $B$ as keys
- Create a table $C, B$ with $C$ as the key

Note that there are two minimal covers for this specific example; the other is $G = \{ AD \rightarrow D, AB \rightarrow C, C \rightarrow B \}$.

##### Lossless Join and FD-Preserving Decomposition into 3NF

Adds a new step to ensure all functional dependencies are kept: if none of the relations' keys contains the key of the universal relation, create another table that contains the key.
