# 02. Principles

Controversial topic debates: defending extreme viewpoints is difficult and requires research to justify the viewpoint.

Software engineering principles not black and white:

- Contradicting principles
- Dependent on context, priorities, constraints, requirements
- Software is abstract; unlike other engineering areas, there are no laws of physics; we create the rules

## Technical Debt

Design decisions made in the past under circumstances that are no longer relevant
Conscious, un-ideal decisions made in the past that must be corrected

Ward Cunningham, 1992: quick and easy approach that comes with interest - additional work that must be done in the future: the longer you wait, the more code relies on the debt - interest grows over time.

Design stamina hypothesis (Martin Fowler): in a time-functionality graph:

- Good design is linear
- Bad/no design starts of faster, but drops off over time
- Where the lines meet is the *design payoff line*

### Types of Technical Debt

Two axes: deliberate/inadvertent, and reckless/prudent

- Deliberate-reckless: don't have time to design
- Deliberate-prudent: must ship now and deal with the consequences
  - The 'best' type of technical debt
- Inadvertent-reckless: not understanding the technical debt in the project
  - The worst type: don't even know you are accruing technical debt
- Inadvertent-prudent: understanding the accrued technical debt only after writing it

### Reasons for Debt

- Time: deadlines
  - Faster time to market may lead to increased short-/long-term budget
  - Prototypes: usually end up being part of the shipping product even though they should be thrown out once they are done
- Money: budget constraints
  - Interest must be paid eventually though
- Knowledge/experience

Caused by:

- Change in business decisions
- Market changes
- Scope changes/creep
  - The scrum master should:
    - Be the interface between the development team and the rest of the world: marketing, management, etc.
    - Never be part of the development team; they should be part of the management so that they have the authority to protect the team and say 'no' to the needs/wants of others
      - In reality, it is cheaper to have them part of the team
- Resourcing changes
- Poor management
- Inexperienced team

### Measuring Technical Debt

302: a lot of debt by the end of the year.

Measure how much technical debt there is by:

- Checking how much refactoring is being done
- Measuring sprint velocity
  - **This must be done from the start**

Types of debt:

- Deliberate technical debt can easily be measured by documenting the debt how much time it would take to pay it off
- Inadvertent technical debt is more difficult to measure
- Debt from third-party libraries is inadvertent, reckless technical debt (although we can get a rough estimate of debt using metrics like the number of open issues)

Interest rates:

- If the interest rate is high, it will only be used in extreme circumstances
  - e.g. preparing for demo for VC funding
  - For critical applications (e.g. planes, banks), technical debt is extremely expensive
- Sometimes, the debt never needs to be paid off:
  - Prototypes
  - When you won't build on top of the debted code
  - Programs with short lifespans - e.g. for short advertising campaign
  - Firmware - will rarely be updated
    - But when a new version of the hardware is released, it will likely be reused

Positive/negative value, visible/invisible attributes:

- Visible, positive: feature
- Visible, negative: bug
- Invisible, positive: architecture
- Invisible, negative: technical debt

Pick a process/framework (Scrum/Kanban/Waterfall): Which part is devoted to Technical Debt correction/payment?

### Fan-in vs Fan-out

- Fan-in:
  - Number of direct dependents
  - Utility functions should have a high fan-in
  - the larger the fan in, the more stuff breaks when the module breaks
- Fan-out:
  - Number of direct dependencies
  - Initialization function will likely have a very high fan-out
  - Any dependency breaking may break the entire module

### Refactor vs Re-engineering

- Refactor: rewrite that does not change the module's external interface ('refactor' in IDEs change method names and hence signatures, so it isn't actually a refactor)
- Re-engineering: rewrite that changes the interface and hence requires dependents to be updated

Hence, **refactorings should be done as-you-go** while re-engineerings should be done infrequently and only after careful planning.

### Reuse vs KISS

Object-oriented programming built on:

- Code reuse
- Modeling the real world

But reuse didn't work - requirements for each program and the abstractions required differ.

Reuse is **big design up front**:

- Waterfall: objects and entities must be designed
- 'Just in case' planning
- Generalized utility functions
- More planning/analyses = cost savings (*if* you get it right)
- Bugs easier to find and fix

Unfortunately, determining the 'correct' design is impossible until implementation.

## Debate: Always/Never Write Documentation

Always:

- Onboarding/knowledge transfer
- Justifying design decisions
- Large codebases, makes navigability easier (usability)

Never:

- Documentation always lags behind; old documentation can be counter-productive
- Reading the code can be more useful than reading documentation
- Documentation can be an excuse for bad/complex code

Always, counterpoints:

- Complexity of code matches complexity of the problem space: code describes how, not why
  - Documentation: high-level overview
- Technical debt: code will not be perfect; need documentation to explain what needs to be changed
- Documentation should be written before the code (like TDD) - in this case, documentation will always be updated (like TDD)
- Onboarding new technologies

Never, counterpoints:

- Bob Martin: "*A comment is a failure to express yourself in code. If you fail, then write a comment; but try not to fail*"
- Documentation not being updated still remains an additional risk
- There should always be an obvious solution
- Code too complicated to be understandable: can always be simplified to a point where the code is self-explanatory
- Grady Booch: "*Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designerâ€™s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.*"
