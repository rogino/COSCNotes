# 07. Project Management

Industry compared to SENG302:

- Scrum masters usually normal developers: saves money
- Focus on the product, not the developers
  - As long as Moffat is in charge, there will never be real customers (again)
- Efficiency: streamlining resources and money

SENG302 teaches you an ideal way that software development *should* work, which businesses which may not follow for efficiency reasons.

## Exercise: Design a Software Methodology

Exercise: design and justify a software methodology that will replace current agile methodologies:

- Description
- Timeline
- Roles, ceremonies, events
- Processes

Use limited subset:
Assume: Company building project with its own PO (not an agency building products for an external customers):

- Stakeholders = company staff + end users
- Product manager: developer in charge
- Specialized developers
  - Sub-teams
    - Team lead: normal developer
      - Team lead in charge of feedback
  - Shared backlog visible to everyone
  - 'Exchange' programs: peer review code from other sub-teams to get a better idea of the challenges faced outside their own sub-team
- Agile but not agile
- Development cycles:
  - Interview and gather feedback from potential end-users
    - Determine how the product being built will fit into their workflow
    - PM picks features
    - ... Isn't this Agile
  - Continuous development: ship as soon as a feature is done
  - Team meetings:
    - Weekly meetings within sub-team; team lead
    - Developer adds log/message as task is completed
  - Gather feedback
    - Dev team also spends some time as customer service
- 20% of developer time also spent on whatever they want: QoL improvements that never get prioritized

Other teams:

- Not scrum 1:
  - Stories planned
  - Sprint length determined by customer
  - Daily stand-ups
  - Informal weekly demos
- Pirate:
  - Captain: PM
  - Quartermaster: represents team
  - Daily standups, must be virtual
  - Three week sprints, one week verification/validation, documentation etc.
    - Anything you should have done but didn't do during the sprint
  - Weekly planning meeting
- Chaos engineering:
  - Team leader: unilateral authority. Rotates every sprint
    - Abuse authority, get screwed by the team next week
  - Week long sprints
    - No formal planning beyond this point
    - Team can discuss among themselves knowing the rotation order
  - Negotiates with PO, but team leader has control
    - PO doesn't own the product
  - Anything not completed gets dropped; up to the new team leader to decide
  - Meeting at start of the sprint: task delegation
- Distributed team
  - Team representative summarizes work and presents to PO
  - Retros every month: written report
- Variable teams
  - Scrum as a base
  - No estimates: tasks discussed in planning period, but not estimated
  - Team chooses sprint duration
  - Team decides number of developers each sprint
    - Developers not part of sprints work on general codebase issues
  - Randomized task allocation
  - Tasks should all work towards some small theme/story
- Continuous
  - PO: reviews code
  - Planner: generates tasks, estimates
  - Testers: TDD
  - Developers: develop
  - Daily stand-ups
  - Monthly process review: entire team
- Not scrum 2:
  - Scrum, but even more agile
  - Stories with ACs defined by PO
  - Day of spikes to research
    - Sprint length defined by this
  - Tasking done by developers as you go: no estimates
  - Team leader acts as team's task reviewer
- Genetic algorithm
  - No planning, two week sprints
  - Half of the products die
  - Products randomly merged together into new products
    - How? Git merge...
    - Developers merge as they see fit; could completely remove a branch
  - All products get deployed: product that makes the best money survives
  - All the different species are documented
- Zoom people
  - Agile/scrum, but better
  - Had no time to fix bugs etc.
  - Senior dev assigns tasks, with soft deadlines for each tasks
    - Also assigned to bugs/issues
  - No sprints: too much pressure to complete tasks on time
  - Daily update/progress message

Analysis:

- Most lacked justifications: *why*
- Principles: must mention testing, technical debt, quality
- Comments:
  - Shows difficulty of coming up with a good process
  - Large companies:
    - Different departments do different work and have different requirements, leading to each team has its own process/methodologies
    - Internal/external products, small/large organizations
  - Most were based around Agile
  - PO role varied from God to no influence

## Project Management

- Waterfall
- Agile
- Scrum
- ScrumBut
- ScrumAnd
- TODO

Product manager:

- Fredrick Winslow Taylor, 1856-1915
  - 'Father' of scientific/modern project management
  - Documented labor processes
    - How much raw material is coming in, how efficient is the output?
  - Standardized processes and measured performance
  - Aimed at business owners:
    - Can reduce labor cost by doing XYZ
    - Wanted to get rid of unions: unpopular
    - Metrics used to measure individual performance: never do this
- Henry Gantt, 1861-1919
  - Focused on scheduling: task dependencies
  - Appealed to workers: short workweeks, higher pay
  - Created Gaant chart
  - Used by navy shipbuilders, WW1 logistics/supply
- Great depression:
  - Workers used to be employed at a single company for life
  - Workers laid off or companies fold down
  - Works Progress Administration: Hoover Dam, airports etc. build
  - Many projects in progress in parallel
  - Led to project managers
- Lockheed Martin: mounting missiles to submarines
  - Program evaluation and review technique (PERT) charts:
    - Optimistic time for project (best case)
    - Most probable amount of time (normal)
    - Pessimistic time (worst case)
    - Expected time (best estimate plus delays)
- PERT further developed by DuPont, Remington Rand:
  - Critical path method (CPM): tasks which, if delayed, delay the entire project
  - Critical path is the most important determinant of schedule
- PERT and CPM together:
  - Visualized dependencies for better understanding
  - Identified critical paths
  - Calculated project times: consider early start, late start, slack/delays for each activity
  - Probability driven: probability of completing at a particular time
  - Visual charts
    - Could get massive
  - Waterfall project management
  - Not good for:
    - Variability/uncertainties
    - Flexibility/changing scope
    - TODO
- Toyota: 14 Principles
  - Published 2001
  - Very large influence on software development
  - Car manufacturing: a lot of raw material and a lot of interdependent steps led to a lot of waiting time in case of delays
  - Each area had to have a lot of raw materials just-in-case
  - Goal: manage bottlenecks for each area in order to manage work in progress
  - Philosophy:
    - Base management decision on long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals
      - Ethical values: can do what you say
      - Cultural values
      - TODO
    - Create continuous processes to bring problems to the surface
      - Eliminate waste through continuous management
      - The product can continue as long as the customer keeps paying us: iterative and continuous
    - Use 'pull' systems to reduce overproduction
      - Raw materials 'pushed' into the next steps
      - Rather, work should be pulled from the steps before
        - If customers don't need the product, nothing should get made
        - Snow-ploughing: tasks get pulled to in progress when a task gets done
    - Level out workload
      - Reduce unevenness
      - Consistent, sustainable stream of work
      - Reduce muri TODO
    - Culture of quality
      - If a problem is found, fix it
      - Get quality right the first time
      - Refactor continuously, re-engineer rarely, rewrite never
      - Measure and pay off technical debt
    - Process for continuous improvement
      - Kaizen: continuous improvement
      - Empower employees: sof-organizing, self-directed teams
      - Inspect and adapt
      - Processes: review, retrospectives, stand-ups
      - Reflection
    - Efficient workspace, use visual control
      - Task board
        - Use often and regularly
        - Keep in a prominent place
      - Red/green: always know the current status
      - Visualize pipelines, builds etc.
      - Place retro items
      - TODO
    - Use reliable, thoroughly-tested technologies
      - Use the appropriate technology for the job: don't push technology onto the project
      - Applies to languages, frameworks/libraries, design patterns
    - Grow people/leaders who thoroughly understand the work, philosophy, and who will teach it at others
      - Scrum masters
        - Should not be developers
        - They should be learning about whatever they will be teaching the team
        - They should be teaching/educating the customer so that they understand what they are doing and what the team expects from them
      - Flat hierarchy
      - TODO
      - A 'learning  organization'
        - CMMI: organization must improve
    - Develop exceptional people/teams who follow the organization's philosophy
      - Success is based on the team, not the individual
      - Remove silos, lower bus factor
      - Team, not individual code ownership
        - Javadoc: has fields for author name
      - Create and document processes, principles
      - Flat hierarchy: self-directed, empowered teams
        - Requires even experience
        - TODO
        - Initiative: someone must take the initiative and drive things forwards
      - Teach individuals
      - Continuous improvement (Kaizen)
    - Respect your extended network and help them improve
      - Suppliers etc. are also stakeholders
      - Teach customers (e.g. methodology being used, what is expected of them)
      - Update customers/stakeholders often and get feedback from them
      - Use processes that increase communication and transparency
    - Experience it first-hand to understand the situation
      - Waterfall approach: what the customer asked for was not what the end-user actually needs
      - Need to see for yourself to understand the situation
      - Empathy driven design
      - Think about the customer's environment
        - e.g. network speed, computer performance, familiarity with computers
    - Make decisions by consensus, consider all options, implemnt rapidtly
      - Candidates olutions with pros/cons
      - Spike and prototype
      - No hero culture: team is involved in decisions
      - High communication: task board, logging, communication tools, ceremonies, meeting
      - Fail fast, fail often
    - Become a learning organization through relentless reflection (hansei) and continuous improvement (kaizen)
      - Document learning from previous projects
      - Evaluate, measure, analyze, reflect
      - Use metrics to improve
        - e.g. Sprint velocity
        - Not often done in business: no immediate ROI
        - Need to understand what the metrics mean
        - Tools aren't very good
          - Defaults settings must be changed: otherwise can get overwhelmed
      - Use tools to give real-time metrics
      - Standardize across the organization, but with flexibility built in
        - Communicate findings across the organization

## Three M's (wasteful actions)

Used in Lean

1. Muda
  - Wastefulness
  - Work that adds no value
    - Goldplating
    - Things you think the customer may need but never will
    - Over-engineering
    - Compare to work that adds value but is not recognized
2. Mura
  - Irregularity/lack of uniformity in the work
  - Variability that causes muda
  - Kanban attempts to address this
3. Muri
  - Don't overwork the people or the equipment
  - Leads to unsustainable development
  - Prone to failure

### Waterfall

There is no development method called 'waterfall': it is an umbrella term.

Software development life cycle (SDLC):

- Requirements analysis
  - A huge amount of documentation, UML diagrams etc.
  - Legal representatives from both companies often involved
    - Who's fault is this?
- Planning
  - Every decision signed off by management and/or the customer
- Software design
- Development
- Testing/Validation
- Deployment
- Maintenance

Waterfall *can* be iterative: a lot of overhead.

Why use waterfall?

- Scheduling: dependencies known and can be time boxed
- Clients can give them requirements and then ignore them until it is done
- For projects with known scopes
  - Agile projects have no ending
- For critical systems:
  - Avionics/space, medical, infrastructure
- Low-trust environments:
  - Government departments
  - Big institutions
  - When someone needs to be blamed and pay up



Waterfall TOOD:

- Distinct sequential phases
- Well known problem:
  - Low amounts of research needed
  - Low amounts of flexibility needed
- Predictable:
  - Dependencies can be mapped out
  - Known architecture and technologies
- Very high quality is required
  - Time devloted to getting high quality
- Higher expense built in (known phases)
- Low-trust between the business and customers


Agile is very expensive:

- Changing requirements leads to more re-engineering
- High technical debt: fast time to market, but has costs further down the road

Extreme Programming (XP):

- Focus on adaptability (rather than predictability)
- Assumes that requirements cannot be predicted at the beginning of software projects
- Four values
  - Improve communication
  - Seek simplicity
  - Seek feedback
  - TODO Courage
- Four activities:
  - Coding
  - Testing
  - Listening (to customers, to the team, to stakeholders)
  - Designing
- Good programming practices pushed to the extreme (or what was considered extreme when it was created):
  - Code reviews:
    - Reviewed all the time through pair programming
    - Rather than at the end
  - Testing:
    - Test all the time
    - Maybe through TDD ()
    - Everyone tests, including the customer
  - Design:
    - Everyone is responsible for the design
    - Refactor continuously
  - Simplicity:
    - Start with the smallest, simplest solution
  - Integration testing:
    - Integrate multiple times a day
  - Short iterations:
    - Make iterations as short as possible
    - Release plan(months), iteration plans(weeks), acceptance test (day), stand-up meeting (day), pair negotiation (horus), unit testing (minutes), pair programming (seconds)
  - 12 practices
    - Planning games, user stories
    - Small releases
    - Metaphors
    - Simple design: YAGNI
    - Testing
    - Refactoring
    - Pair programming
    - Collective ownership
    - 40 hour weeks: sustainable development

Agile principles:

- **Agile is not a methodology**
  - You do not 'do' Agile
  - There are other methodologies/frameworks that *follow* the Agile principles
- Iterative, structured
- Very product-based: product and quality matter
- Very team-based: self-organizing, flat hierarchy
- Principles:
- Values:

Lean:

- Came from manufacturing
- Created by the Lean Enterprise Institute (1997)
- Focuses on eliminating waste
- Onlly have what we need at the point in time where we need it
- Five key principles:
  - Identify value:
    - What does the customer need?
  - Map value stream:
   - What steps and activites are required to make and deliver the product?
   - Eliminate steps that do not create value
 - Create flow:
   - Remove bottlenecks
   - Keep value-occurring steps in tight sequence
 - Establish pull:
   - Just-in-time delivery: customer gets what they need as they need it
 - Seek perfection:
   - Continous improvement

Scrum:

- Flexible but formal
- **Framework** - does not define processes
  - Does not define roles, how to test etc.
  - Simply gives you a structure to work around
- Ceremonies
- Roles
- Regular, fixed-length sprints
- Event-driven
- Fairly predictable with defined, bite-size goals
- Small, self-organizing teams
  - Can have teams-of-teams
  - Orthogonal teams (e.g. UX team responsible for all product UX within a organization)

Kanban:

- Very flexible
- Concerned with **throughput**
- Maximizes efficiency/flow
- Not as much process: no ceremonies, no roles
- No iterations: continuous flow
- Good for continuous production
- Not concerned with teams

Scrumban:

- Scrum structure with Kanban's flexibility
- Short iterations
- No roles
- Not concered with teams: can conatin generalists and specialists
- Daily standups and optional ceremonies
- Sometimes called 'controlled Kanban'

Project Managment Certifications:

- A few avaialble. The most popular are:
  - Project Manaagement Prfessional (PMP) certification
  - Offered by Project Mangemetn Institute (PMI)
  - Use Project Mnagement Book of Knoweldge (PMBOK Giude)
  - Principles of project management 
  - TODO
TOOD
- PRINCE2 Principles
  - Continued business justifiation: tasks must have a clear ROI and the use of time/resources must be justified
  - TODO
  - Manage by stages
  - Manage by exception:
    - Measure delegated authority and outcomes within the process
    - Create contingencies and action plans
  - Focus on products:
    - Product requirements determine work activity, not the other way around
  - tailor to suite project environment
    - highlight the necessary risk, time, capability, size, complexity and cruicial components for the project
    - Use the tools (e.g. langague, frameworks) that best fit the enevironment
