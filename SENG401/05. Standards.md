# 05. Standards

## Standards

Groups of international experts sharing knowledge to develop solutions to common problems found in a range of activities.

Standards help with:

- Sharing knowledge
  - Identifying aspects/pitfalls
  - Understanding why processes exist:
    - Chesterton's Fence
    - Regulations are written in blood
- Creating a shared language
- Creating regulations/policies
- Understanding and addressing problems/challenges
- Giving customers some confidence in products/organizations
  - And customers expect others to use them or at least know about them
- Allows consistency and interoperability between systems

Some organizations:

- ISO: International Organization for Standardization
- IEEE Standards Association
- International Electrotechnical Commission

Problems:

- [Competing standards](https://xkcd.com/927/)
- Usually very generic
- Can be heavy in red tape/process: requires lots of polices, documents, data gathering
- Little immediate reward; very boring
- May require certification to give confidence to customers

Understanding the standard does not mean you understand how to apply them/implement the solution or attain quality.

One of UC's (5th?) student management system:

- 26 million paid initially to create new system, 2 million per year support
- Delivered
- Crashes; enrollment delayed
- Provider says issue with environment
- Buy new servers; still not working
- Upgrade network; still not working
- Give up; go back to old system
- Millions wasted, students may have enrolled elsewhere due to delay, admin delayed, staff annoyed

## Quality and Service Standards

IEEE Standard 1012: system, software, and hardware verification and validation.

Determines if requirements are:

- Correct
- Complete
- Accurate
- Consistent
- Testable

4 integrity levels.

### Verification and Validation (V & V)

Comparison:

- Verification:
  - Checking the process during the life cycle activity
  - **Are we building the product correctly?**
  - There is some correlation between process and product; hence, a good process gives some confidence in the quality of the product
- Validation:
  - Checking that the product meets the requirements at the end of life cycle
  - **Did we build the correct product?**
  - Giving customers confidence in the product

Verification:

- Evaluating *work products* during the life cycle activity to determine if it is being built according to the requirements
- Evaluation of:
  - Plans
  - Requirement specifications
  - Design specification
  - Code
  - Test cases
- Through the use of:
  - Reviews
    - e.g. building on different OSes on Erskine ('customer') computers, under heavy load
  - Walkthroughs
    - Informally going through code and/or features with developers
    - Reverse walkthrough: customer explains to developer how to use products to find misunderstandings
  - Inspections
    - Standups, formal sessions etc.

Validation:

- Checking that the code matches user needs and fulfills its intended use
- Were the specifications even correct?
- Evaluation of product/software
- Through the use of testing (e.g. acceptance testing)


Software integrity level (SIL):

1. Negligible consequences if element fails - mitigation not required
2. Minor consequences if element fails - complete mitigation possible
3. Serious consequences if element fails
  - Permanent injury, major system degradation, economic/social impact
  - e.g. bank accounts etc.
  - Partial to complete mitigation required
4. Grave consequences - no mitigation possible
  - loss of life, systems, economic or social loss
