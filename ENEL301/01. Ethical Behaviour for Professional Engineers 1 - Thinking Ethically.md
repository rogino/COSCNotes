# 01. Ethical Behaviour for Professional Engineers 1 - Thinking Ethically

Washington Accords Graduate Requirements apply ethical principles, commit to professional ethics/responsibilities/norms of engineering practice, assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and consequent responsibilities.

Professional engineers must:

- Identify (sometimes competing) ethical concerns
- Analyze the issues underling the concerns
- Respond to the concerns

## Module 2 Outcomes

Students demonstrate understanding of their ethical responsibilities to:

- Self manage in an orderly and ethical manner
- Balance public interest with those of employers/clients
- Uphold engineering profession standards

Students can identify/justify ethical course of action in complex situations

## ENGR101 Revision

Values/Morals:

- Ethical values: individual standards/beliefs of what is right and proper
- Non-ethical values: desires (e.g. wealth, status) that are ethically neutral or orthogonal to ethical values

Ethics is the study of **moral principles**:

- What ought to be done
- What values/morals a person ought to adopt

Laws make up the **minimal standards of conduct**: actions can be legal but not ethical.

Workplace ethics: personal values + organizational values + external environment (government, norms)

Two parts to ethics:

1. Discerning right from wrong
2. Committing to do the right thing

Ethical theories:

- Rule-based: deontology
  - Absolutist position; apply ethical rules in all circumstances
  - What rules should be followed?
    - People have fundamental rights that others have a duty to respect (but rights can conflict)
    - Justice: actions must be fair and just
      - Distributive/equity: people should not be treated differently based on arbitrary characteristics (discrimination, equal pay for equal work)
      - Procedural/impartiality: rules clearly stated and consistently/impartially enforced
      - Compensatory/fairness: compensation for injury by the responsible party (they had control over the matter)
- Ends-based: teleology
  - The ends justify the means: acts are ethical when they achieve the best outcome (for whom?)
  - Utilitarianism: cost-benefit analysis assessing short/long term impacts on all stakeholders; maximize overall happiness
  - Does not care about the distribution of suffering/happiness, only the total amount
- Virtues-based
  - If an act is what a virtuous person would do under the same circumstances

Some rule books:

- Golden rule: treat others as you would wish to be treated

- 'Prima Facie' Duties Framework
  - Fidelity: keep promises, don't tell lies
  - Reparation: fix what you have done wrong
  - Gratitude
  - Justice, beyond the letter of the law
  - Beneficence: do good if you can
  - Self-improvement
  - Non-maleficence: do not harm others
- Weinstein's Five Ethical Principles
  - Do no harm; prevent harm
  - Make things better; do good
  - Respect others
  - Be fair
  - Be compassionate

- Kant universalizability imperative: if everyone acted according to some rule, what rule would produce the best world

Tests:

- Harms (teleology): do the benefits outweigh the harms, short- and long-term
- Reversibility (deontology, golden rule): would I make the same decision if I traded places
- Colleague (deontology, codes): what would my colleagues/professional code of ethics say
- Legality (deontology, law): would it violate the law or organizational policies
- Common-practice test (deontology, Kant): what if everyone behaved this way
- Publicity, hiding test: how would the action look on the news

TL;DR:

- Is it legal
- Stakeholder analysis; who is affected, how?
- Is it 'right'
- Does it with with company/professional/personal values
- How will I feel afterwards
- Will it reflect poorly on the company/profession/me?
- Is there a better course of action

Rationalizations for unethical behaviour:

- 'It's not really illegal'
- Is in everyone's best interest
- No one will find out
- Organization will 'protect' you
