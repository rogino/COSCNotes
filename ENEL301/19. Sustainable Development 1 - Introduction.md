# 19. Sustainable Development 1 - Introduction

Brundtland Commission's definition for sustainability:

> Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs

Ngai Tahu Vision Statement:

> Mō tātou, ā, mō kā uri ā muri ake nei
>
> For us and our children after us

Sustainability is:

- A professional requirement:
  - The Washington Accords
  - Engineering NZ's Code of Ethical Conduct
    - Protect people's health and safety
    - Consider the environment
- A global priority
  - UN Sustainable Development Goals
  - Paris Accords: 1.5° degree goal
    - Monetary repercussions for not meeting goals
- NZ committed to international sustainability targets
- We live here; basic hygiene
- Employers care
  - e.g. Fisher and Paykel Healthcare integrate UN goals and stakeholder concerns into their plans
  - May be lip service, but it will still be positive

NZ, 2020:

- 75% energy self-sufficiency
- Renewable energy 40.3% of total primary energy supply (including transportation, fuel, etc.)
- 81% renewable electricity generation, ~95% 2038
  - Not 100% as in dry years, other renewable sources cannot pick up the slack: some fossil fuels required

Ministry for the Environment 2019 climate change programme:

- Focus on leadership internationally
- Productive, sustainable and client-resilient economy
- Just and inclusive society
  - Social and environmental issues interlinked

Climate Change Reponse Amendment Act 2019:

- Reduce net emission of greenhouse gases (biogenic methanes (cows)) to zero by 2050
  - Gross emissions is what is emitted, net is gross minus carbon credits, trees you paid to be planted in other countries etc.
- Reduce emissions of biogenic methane by 24-47% below 2017 levels

Financial Sector Amendment Bill:

- NZ to introduce law to require financial sector to disclose impacts of climate change on their business
  - Transparency if businesses are investing in fossil fuels etc.

NZ emission reduction targets: four **unconditional** national targets (conditional: tragedy of the commons)

- Kyoto Protocols:
  - Reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2012 (met)
  - 5% below 1990 levels by 2020
  - 50% below 1990 levels by 2050
- Paris Accords:
  - 30% below 2005 levels by 2030
    - 11% below 1990 levels

NZ Greenhouse Gas Inventory:

- In 2019, NZ's gross emissions were 82.3 million tonnes CO2 equivalent
- Gross emissions increased 26% between 1990 and 2019
- Gross emissions are 48% from agriculture, 42% from energy
- Net emissions of 54.9 Mt CO2 e
- Meeting 2020 Kyoto goals by planting trees (or paying other countries)
  - 33% of gross emissions offset
- NZ will buy 14 billion dollars of carbon credits from other countries over 10 years
  - Cheaper than reducing emissions domestically
    - Subsidizing private EVs won't really help: small in terms of overall emissions
      - \$8,500 subsidy, but many people drive cheap, old cars - no way to afford EVs
        - The people that drive the most polluting (oldest) cars are also the people least likely to pay the additional taxes from pollution
    - Electricity generation already pretty clean
      - Nuclear power is very clean
    - Agriculture is the industry responsible for the most emissions, but also very important to NZ's economy
  - Cost of carbon credits may increase

Kaitiakitanga: being responsible in relation to natural and physical resources: stewardship

Issues:

- Pollution
- Rising consumption in developing countries
  - Damage done decades ago by industrial countries: now first world countries
  - Unfair to developing countries when we did the same in the industrial revolutions?
  - Is concern for the environment a 'first world' privilege?
- Resource depletion
  - Fresh water
  - Loss of land
    - Rising sea levels
    - Lifestyle blocks
- Biodiversity depletion
- Famine
  - Climate change, loss of agricultural land, over-fishing/exploitation of resources
  - Organic farming reduces productivity levels

As a computer/electrical/mechatronics engineer:

- Renewable energy sources
- Integrating renewable power into power gid
- Energy storage
- EVs
- Reducing EoL waste, energy efficient systems

As a software engineer:

- Energy-efficiency
- Sustainability reporting software
- Understanding client change

Considering impacts: some are not 'reasonably forseeable':

- Lithium, graphic, cobalt mining
- Cryptocurrency
