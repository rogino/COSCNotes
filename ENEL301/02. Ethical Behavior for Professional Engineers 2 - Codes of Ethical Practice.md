# 02. Ethical Behavior for Professional Engineers 2: Codes of Ethical Practice

Professionals:

- Are experts and commit to staying up-to-date
- Use their expertise responsibility for the greater good
- Self regulate
- Have **professional obligations** (duties) that do not depend on personal moral positions
- Must act ethically and abide by the standards set by the profession as the whole

Lessons from 737 MAX: need for broader focus on **moral courage** in ethics education.

Common rules:

- Public interest: in the course of engineering activities
  - Take reasonable steps to safeguard public interest
  - Have regards to effects on environment
  - Report adverse consequences
- Act competently
  - Ensure knowledge and skills up to date
  - Only in your area of competence
  - Allow others to misrepresent their competence
- Personal conduct
  - Act honestly, objectively, with integrity
  - Respect others
  - Disclose conflicts of interest
  - Confidentiality
    - Unless it breaks other rules, must be by law, or is publicly available

Codes of conducts aren't worth the paper they're written on if is not enforced.

## AI and Robotics

UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Council:

- Robots should not be designed as weapons
  - Except for national security
- Robots should be designed to comply with existing laws
- Robots are products and hence should be designed to be safe and secure
- Robots are manufactured artifacts; it should not use the illusion of emotions and intent to exploit vulnerable users
- It should be possible to find out who is responsible for any robot

Google:

- AI should be socially beneficial (utilitarianism) - proceed where likely benefits substantially exceed foreseeable risks and downsides
- Will not pursue:
  - Technologies likely to cause overall harm
  - Weapons or technologies where the principle purpose is to harm people
  - Surveillance technologies violating internationally-accepted norms
  - Technologies that contravene widely accepted principles of international law or human rights

Lots of wiggle room.
