# 04. Engineering Management 1 - Introduction to Management Thinking

## Introduction

Understanding the basic principles of managing:

- People
- Groups and teams
- Organizations
- Finances
- Projects

Is essential for competent engineers.

Definition of management:

> Management is getting things done in organizations through people.
>
> *Mary Parker Follet*

Taking inputs and *optimizing* the transformation process.

Leads to

Systems theory of organization:

- Organizations are systems
- Systems are sets of interrelated parts operating as a whole in pursuit of a common goal
- Has four major components: inputs, transformation processes, output, feedback

### The Process of Management

Before getting things done, the following must be established:

- What is the purpose of the organization (vision, mission)
- Why is the organization pursuing the vision?
- How will the organization achieve the vision (strategy)

```
Vision and mission: organization's purpose
                   |
                   | leads to
                   v
Strategy: how the objectives will be achieved
                   |
                   | leads to
                   v
Implementation: resource allocation, operations needed 
                to fulfil the strategy
```

### Challenges

- Productivity
- Efficiency
- Customer sat
- Profitability (or other performance indicators)

But recently also:

- Sustainability
- Equity/diversity
- Continuous change

### Roles of a Manager

POLC:

- Planning: setting performance objectives and deciding how to achieve them
- Organizing: arranging tasks, people and other resources to accomplish the work
- Leading: inspiring people to work hard to achieve high performance
- Controlling: measuring performance and taking action to ensure desired results

#### Organising

Structuring an organization and creating conditions/systems where people/resources work to gether to achieve organizational goals:

- Resource allocation, task allocation, creating procedures, policies, processes
- Organizational structure with clear lines of authority/responsibility
- Recruitment, training
- Allocating employees where they will be most effective

#### Leading

Creating a vision and guiding/training/coaching/motivating others:

- Guiding/motivating others
- Giving assignments
- Explaining routines/procedures/policies
- Providing performance feedback

#### Planning

Anticipating trends, determining the best strategies/tactics to achieve organizational goals/objectives:

- Setting organizational goals
- Developing strategies
- Determining resources
- Setting standards

#### Controlling

Determining if an organization is progressing towards goals/objectives, and taking corrective actions if required:

- Measuring results against objectives
- Monitoring performance relative to standards
- Rewarding outstanding performance
- Taking corrective action

##### Management Skills

- Technical skills; applying expertise on technical tasks
- Human/interpersonal skills; working in cooperation with others
- Conceptual skills; analytic thinking to solve problems

Higher level managers concentrate more on conceptual skills, but human skills are important regardless of level.

## How to Manage

### History

#### Classical Theories

Telling people what to do, motivating them with money.

##### Scientific Management

Improving the workers, watching the workers all the time to ensure they don't mess it up. Punish the bad, reward the good.

Engineering the most efficient production methods.

- Developing a science for each element of the job
- Selecting employees and training them to do the job as described
- Supervising employees to ensure they follow the prescribed methods
- Continue to plan the work but use workers to get the work done

Gaant chart: splitting tasks down into smallest components and showing dependencies.

#### Administrative Management

Improving the manager by applying 'universal principles' of efficient management.

- Henri Fayol, 5 duties of management: foresight, organization, command, coordination, control
- Mary Parker Follet: if you share goals with workers, they are likely to help and reduce management conflict
- Chester Barnard: ensuring overlap between natural/informal organization and organizational hierarchy; acceptance theory of authority

#### Bureaucratic Management

Improving efficiency by developing the 'ideal' organization.

Max Weber:

- Clear division of labour
- Clear hierarchy of authority
- Careers based on merit
- Formal rules and procedures
- Impersonality

#### Behavioral Management Theories

Mayo Hawthorne Studies:

- Gas vs electric lighting; electric companies began market that more factory lighting led to improved efficiency
  - Both experimental and control groups had improved efficiency
  - Tried decreasing lighting levels of control groups; both groups had same efficiency increases
  - Workers were excited about the experiment and worked harder
  - Standardized processes led to boredom; freedom led to workers finding more efficient methods of doing work and higher output
- Conclusions
  - Workers have needs other than money
  - Recognition, security, sense of belonging effects workers' morale and productivity

Maslow's hierarchy of needs; needs have to be satisfied in order of:

- Physiological: food, water etc.
- Safety: of body, employment, family etc.
- Love/belonging: friendship, family, sexual intimacy
- Esteem: confidence, achievement, respecting others/respect by others
- Self-actualization: morality, creativity etc.

If a need is satisfied, it will no longer motivate people.

At work:

- Physiological: adequate salary and working conditions
- Safety: job security, safe working conditions
- Social: happy work team, friendly, healthy workplace relationships
- Esteem: helping others reach their potential, giving recognition, giving others recognition and responsibility
- Self-actualization: challenging, creative work

McGregor; Theory X/Y:

- Theory X Managers:
  - Average humans inherently dislike work and will avoid it
  - Hence they must be coerced, controlled or otherwise threatened with punishment
  - They which to be directed, avoid responsibility, have little ambition, and want security
- Theory Y Managers; humanistic approach:
  - Work is natural; people do not dislike it
  - External control/threats are not the only way to get people to work towards the organization's objectives
  - People seek responsibility
  - Capability to exercise a high degree of imagination/creativity is widely distributed
  - Intellectual potentials of the average person only partially utilized

**Human resource approach**: people are social and self-actualizing. X/Y acknowledges that only some people are, and that good managers should be able to identify workers as such and treat them accordingly.

- Let people participate in deciding what to do
- Give responsibility where appropriate
- Money alone is not a sufficient motivator

#### Quantitative Management Theories

Modern management theory

Theory Z: combination of American and Japanese (LEAN) management styles

Contingency theory: no universal principle, use contingency principles instead; appropriate managerial actions depend on the situation.
