# 05. Future of Autonomous Biosecurity Sensing

In the future, it is reasonable to expect huge swarms of low cost drones that are scanning for biosecurity etc.

Assume a central base station that controls the paths of the drones. How would you would violate the security of the drones?

- Jam signal
  - Frequency hopping?
  - P2P communication will make jamming more difficult
  - If close enough, can locate self relative to other drones visually
- GPS spoofing?
  - Or just jam GPS
    - Use local map and determine position using landmarks, inertial sensors etc.
  - Gradually shift position to cause them to crash?
- Replay attack?
  - Timestamp packets, max age
  - P2P sharing of latest command index/timestamp in system; if one drone can hear the original signal, they can share it with others to prevent replays
- Spoof commands
  - Sign packets with public key encryption
  - Commands from base station sent peer to peer so jamming will be difficult
- PKI to establish symmetric key
  - Shoot down a drone and extract keys?
  - Hardware security modules; no way to access key
