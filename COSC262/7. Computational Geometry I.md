# 7. Computational Geometry I

## Introduction

Be aware of:

- Floating point errors
  - Nearly-parallel lines
  - Very thin/long rectangles
  - Points very close together
- Special cases
  - Coincident points
  - Intersecting lines
- Degenerate cases
  - Zero area triangles

This course simplifies this by using integer cartesian grids and avoiding division, square roots, trig etc.

Sidenote - basic `matplotlib` example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
vertices = [(0,0), (1,2), (2,4)]
vx, vy = zip(*vertices) # Unzip the array into x and y components
axes = plt.axes()
axes.plot(vx, vy, color="blue", marker="o")
plt.show()
```

## Points, Vectors & Lines

### Definitions

Point:

- Position in space
- $(x, y)$ tuple
- Uppercase, non-bold, non-italic letters

Vector:

- Difference between two points
- $(dx, dy)$ tuple
- The vector from $A$ to $B$ is $v = (b_x-a_x,  b_y-a_y )$
- Lowercase, bold, italic letters
- Position vector
  - Vector from origin to some given point

### Basic Operations

Points:

- Subtract to get displacement vector
- Linear/affine sum:
  - $P(\alpha) = (1-\alpha)A + \alpha B$
  - Indivisible, two operation operand
  - Points on the line between A and B
  - $P(0) = A$
  - $P(1) = B$
- The linear sum is the equation of the line: use this instead of $y = mx + c$ as it does not work with vertical lines

Vectors:

- Addition, subtractions
- Multiplication by scalar
- Addition to a point to get another point
- Magnitude: $|v|^2=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}$
- Dot product
- Signed triangle area

### Vector Operations

Dot Product:

- $p \cdot q = p_x q_x + p_y q_y=|p\|q|\cos{\theta}$
- $p \cdot q > 0$ when the angle is acute: angle in $(0,90)$ or $(270,360)$
- $p \cdot q = 0$ when they are perpendicular

#### Signed Area/Turn Direction

The area of parallelogram is:

$$
p_x q_y-p_y q_x=|p\|q|\sin{\theta}
$$

This is equivalent to the magnitude of the cross product where $p$, $q$ are two edge vectors for vectors $B$ and $C$ respectively, relative to the point $A$.

The area of triangle is half of this.

The **area is positive if $b$ is 'counterclockwise' to $c$, centered around $a$** and zero when the points are collinear (parallel).

Checking if $P$ is on the line $(A,B)$:

- Check if signed area 0
- To check if it is on the line segment (i.e. Between $A$ and $B$):
  - $|P,A| \le |A,B|$ and $|P,B|<|A,B|$
  - Where $|X,Y|$ is the distance between the points $X$ and $Y$

Turn Direction:

- Just check the sign of the signed area (unless the area is zero)

Line Segment Intersection:

- Two line segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect iff $C$ and $D$ are on opposite sides of the line $AB$ and vice-versa
- True if `isCCW(A,B,D) != isCCW(A,B,C) && isCCW(C,D,A) != isCCW(C,D,B)` (where the first argument is the origin)

Degenerate cases:

- One point on the line
- Sharing a point
- All four points collinear

## Simple Polygons

By convention, vertices are in counter-clockwise order.

Convex Polygons:

- Every interior angle less than 180 degrees
  - Strictly less than for strictly convex polygon
- Every counter-clockwise traversal turns left at every vertex (or goes straight)

### Point Inclusion Test

#### Convex Polygon

For a convex polygon, a point is in a polygon (PiP) if it is on the left side of every edge for an anticlockwise traversal of the polygon:

```python
all([isCCW(vertex[i], vertex[(i + 1) % len(vertex)], P) for i in range(len(vertex))])
```

#### Simple Polygon

- Create a semi-infinite horizontal line starting from $P$ going either left or right
- The point is inside the polygon iff it intersects the polygon an odd number of times
- The line only needs to extend to past the maximum $x$ value for the polygon's edges

Special cases:

- The line goes through a vertex
  - On the 'inside': count 0 or 2 times
  - Otherwise: count 1 time
- Goes along an edge

The correct way to solve this is to:

- Ignore horizontal edges
- If edge directed upwards, count the start vertex as an intersection
- If edge directed down, count the end vertex as an intersection

The hacky solution: all vertices are on an integer grid, so simply move $P$ up by a very small amount (e.g. $10^{-8}$).

Improvements:

- Find the rectangle that encompasses the polygon
  - If its not in the rectangle, then it can't be inside

### Convex Hull Problem

For a finite set of points, the convex hull is the smallest convex polygon enclosing all points. The convex hull:

- Is unique
- Contains every point in the set
- has $(x_{min}, ?)$, $(x_{max}, ?)$, $(?, y_{min})$ and $(?, y_{max})$ as vertices of the convex hull

Naïve solution:

- Construct all possible edges using pairs of points
- For every other point, check if it lies on the left side of the edge. If so, it belongs to the convex hull
- $O(n^3)$

#### Gift Wrap Algorithm

- Start from the point with the minimum $y$ coordinate (or max $y$, or min/max $x$)
  - Choose the left-most one if multiple points have the same minimum
- Select the 'rightmost' point from the perspective of the current point $A$
  - Pick any point $B$
  - For all points $C$
    - Check if $C$ is to the right of $AB$
    - If so, $B = C$
  - The current $B$ is part of the convex hull. Repeat until a closed loop is formed
- Worst case $O(n^2)$
- Normal case $O(mn)$, where $m$ is the number of vertices in the convex hull

#### Graham-Scan Algorithm

An $O(n\log{n})$ algorithm. First construct a simple closed path that includes all points:

- Point $0$ will have the minimum $y$ value, and so is guaranteed to be on the convex hull
- Create a line centered around point $0$ and pointing right
- Rotate the line anticlockwise. When a vertex is found, add them to the list - we are essentially sorting the vertices by angle
- Connect the vertices in the sorted list to create the simple closed path
- Not all vertices will be on the convex hull, so the concavities need to be filled in

##### Sorting without calculating angles

We don't need to know the angle: only the ordering. This can be done using `isCCW`, Python's built in sort function (which will be $n\log{n}$), and `from functools import cmp\_to\_key` or by defining a `SortKey` class with a custom `__lt__` operator and converting the point to that class in the sort fuction's `key` lambda.

Consider edge cases:

- $P_1$  or $P_2$ are the anchor
- Several points colinear with $P_0$  (i.e. on a straight line)
  - Don't worry about them

Concavities:

- $P_0$ and $P_1$  always on the convex hull
- $P_2$ may not be

Initialize a stack with $[P_0, P_1, P_2]$:

- Check if the next point, $n$, is on the left edge of the line connecting $P_{n-2}$ and $P_{n-1}$
- If so, add the point to the stack
- Otherwise, pop from the stack until this is true

Complexity:

- Step 1: find the point with the minimum $y$Y value: $O(n)$
- Step 2: sort operation: $O(n\log{n})$
- Step 3: initialize hull
- Step 4: generate the convex hull
  - Not $O(n^2)$ as although the nested while loop may run several times, it can only remove previously added elements, so you can only ever pop $n$ elements
  - Hence, it is $2n \in O(n)$
